Highly efficient protein machines are formed by incorporating many different protein molecules into larger assemblies that coordinate the allosteric movements of the individual components. Such machines perform most of the important reactions in cells.
Proteins are subjected to many reversible, post-translational modifications, such as the covalent addition of a phosphate or an acetyl group to a specific amino acid side chain. The addition of these modifying groups is used to regulate the activity of a protein, changing its conformation, its binding to other proteins, and its location inside the cell. A typical protein in a cell will interact with more than five different partners. Through proteomics, biologists can analyze thousands of proteins in one set of experiments. One important result is the production of detailed protein interaction maps, which aim at describing all of the binding interactions between the thousands of distinct proteins in a cell. However, understanding these networks will require new biochemistry, through which small sets of interacting proteins can be purified and their chemistry dissected in detail. In addition, new computational techniques will be required to deal with the enormous complexity.
What we don’t know
• What are the functions of the surprisingly large amount of unfolded polypeptide chain found in proteins?
• How many types of protein functions remain to be discovered? What are the most promising approaches for discovering them?
• When will scientists be able to take any amino acid sequence and accurately predict both that protein’s three-dimensional conformations and its chemical properties? What breakthroughs will be needed to accomplish this important goal?
• Are there ways to reveal the detailed workings of a protein machine that do not require the purification of each of its component parts in large amounts, so that the machine’s functions can be reconstituted and dissected using chemical techniques in a test tube?
• What are the roles of the dozens of different types of covalent modifications of proteins that have been found in addition to those listed in Table 3–3? Which ones are critical for cell function and why?
• Why is amyloid toxic to cells and how does it contribute to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease?
