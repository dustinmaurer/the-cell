<voice name="en-US-ChristopherNeural"><lexicon uri="https://cvoiceprodusw.blob.core.windows.net/acc-public-files/b17c5e854155462a8df79933ffd0ab33/21119753-7cf2-4607-a7b3-b4d004813645.xml" />The SCF ubiquitin ligase is a protein complex that binds different “target proteins” at different times in the cell cycle, covalently adding polyubiquitin polypeptide chains to these targets. Its C-shaped structure is formed from five protein subunits, the largest of which serves as a scaffold on which the rest of the complex is built. The structure underlies a remarkable mechanism (Figure 3–71). At one end of the C is an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. At the other end is a substrate-binding arm, a subunit known as an F-box protein. These two subunits are separated by a gap of about 5 nm. When this protein complex is activated, the F-box protein binds to a specific site on a target protein, positioning the protein in the gap so that some of its lysine side chains contact the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. The enzyme can then catalyze repeated additions of ubiquitin polypeptide to these lysines (see Figure 3–71C), producing polyubiquitin chains that mark the target proteins for rapid destruction in a proteasome.</voice>

The timing of the destruction often involves creating a specific pattern of phosphorylation on the target protein that is required for its recognition by the F-box subunit. It also requires the activation of an SCF ubiquitin ligase that carries the appropriate substrate-binding arm. Many of these arms (the F-box subunits) are interchangeable in the protein complex (see Figure 3–71B), and there are more than 70 human genes that encode them.</voice>

Thus, for example, not only are there many F-box proteins—making possible the recognition of different sets of target proteins—but there is also a family of scaffolds (known as cullins) that give rise to a family of SCF-like ubiquitin ligases.</voice>

It also creates opportunities for “rapid” evolution, inasmuch as new functions can evolve for the entire complex simply by producing an alternative version of one of its subunits.</voice>

Some of these complexes are far larger and more complicated than SCF, but their underlying enzymatic function remains the same (Figure 3–71D).</voice></speak>
