However, because of the strong tendency of water molecules to form water–water hydrogen bonds, water molecules exist in a large hydrogen-bonded network (see Panel 2–2, pp. 92–93). In effect, a protein can keep a ligand-binding site dry, increasing that site's reactivity, because it is energetically unfavorable for individual water molecules to break away from this network—as they must do to reach into a crevice on a protein’s surface.</voice>

If protein folding forces together a number of negatively charged side chains against their mutual repulsion, for example, the affinity of the site for a positively charged ion is greatly increased. In addition, when amino acid side chains interact with one another through hydrogen bonds, normally unreactive groups (such as the –CH2OH on the serine shown in Figure 3–39) can become reactive, enabling them to be used to make or break selected covalent bonds.</voice>

For this reason, two slightly different conformations of the same protein molecule can differ greatly in their chemistry.</voice>

<voice name="en-US-ChristopherNeural"><lexicon uri="https://cvoiceprodusw.blob.core.windows.net/acc-public-files/b17c5e854155462a8df79933ffd0ab33/21119753-7cf2-4607-a7b3-b4d004813645.xml" />As we have described previously, genome sequences allow us to group many of the domains in proteins into families that show clear evidence of their evolution from a common ancestor. The three-dimensional structures of members of the same domain family are remarkably similar. For example, even when the amino acid sequence identity falls to 25%, the backbone atoms in a domain can follow a common protein fold within 0.2 nanometers (2 angstrom).</voice>

Those sites that bind to other molecules are the most likely to be maintained, unchanged as organisms evolve. Thus, in this method, those amino acids that are unchanged, or nearly unchanged, in all of the known protein family members are mapped onto a model of the three-dimensional structure of one family member. When this is done, the most invariant positions often form one or more clusters on the protein surface, as illustrated in Figure 3–40A for the SH2 domain described previously (see Figure 3–6). These clusters generally correspond to ligand-binding sites.</voice></speak>
