In this view, ligand binding perturbs an all-or-none equilibrium between these two states, thereby changing the proportion of active molecules. Both models represent true and useful concepts.</voice>

<voice name="en-US-ChristopherNeural"><lexicon uri="https://cvoiceprodusw.blob.core.windows.net/acc-public-files/b17c5e854155462a8df79933ffd0ab33/21119753-7cf2-4607-a7b3-b4d004813645.xml" />Proteins are regulated by more than the reversible binding of other molecules. A second method that eukaryotic cells use extensively to regulate a protein’s function is the covalent addition of a smaller molecule to one or more of its amino acid side chains. The most common such regulatory modification in higher eukaryotes is the addition of a phosphate group. We shall therefore use protein phosphorylation to illustrate some of the general principles involved in the control of protein function through the modification of amino acid side chains.</voice>

First, because each phosphate group carries two negative charges, the enzyme-catalyzed addition of a phosphate group to a protein can cause a major conformational change in the protein by, for example, attracting a cluster of positively charged amino acid side chains. This can, in turn, affect the binding of ligands elsewhere on the protein surface, dramatically changing the protein’s activity. When a second enzyme removes the phosphate group, the protein returns to its original conformation and restores its initial activity.</voice>

As previously discussed, the SH2 domain binds to a short peptide sequence containing a phosphorylated tyrosine side chain (see Figure 3–40B). More than ten other common domains provide binding sites for attaching their protein to phosphorylated peptides in other protein molecules, each recognizing a phosphorylated amino acid side chain in a different protein context. Third, the addition of a phosphate group can mask a binding site that otherwise holds two proteins together, and thereby disrupt protein–protein interactions. As a result, protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation very often drive the regulated assembly and disassembly of protein complexes (see, for example, Figure 15–11).</voice></speak>
