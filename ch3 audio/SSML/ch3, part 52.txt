Such machines perform most of the important reactions in cells.</voice>
<voice name="en-US-ChristopherNeural"><lexicon uri="https://cvoiceprodusw.blob.core.windows.net/acc-public-files/b17c5e854155462a8df79933ffd0ab33/21119753-7cf2-4607-a7b3-b4d004813645.xml" />Proteins are subjected to many reversible, post-translational modifications, such as the covalent addition of a phosphate or an acetyl group to a specific amino acid side chain. The addition of these modifying groups is used to regulate the activity of a protein, changing its conformation, its binding to other proteins, and its location inside the cell. A typical protein in a cell will interact with more than five different partners. Through proteomics, biologists can analyze thousands of proteins in one set of experiments. One important result is the production of detailed protein interaction maps, which aim at describing all of the binding interactions between the thousands of distinct proteins in a cell. However, understanding these networks will require new biochemistry, through which small sets of interacting proteins can be purified and their chemistry dissected in detail. In addition, new computational techniques will be required to deal with the enormous complexity.</voice>
