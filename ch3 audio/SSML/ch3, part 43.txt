<voice name="en-US-ChristopherNeural"><lexicon uri="https://cvoiceprodusw.blob.core.windows.net/acc-public-files/b17c5e854155462a8df79933ffd0ab33/21119753-7cf2-4607-a7b3-b4d004813645.xml" />Detailed structures obtained for one of the GTP-binding protein family members, the EF-Tu protein, provide a good example of how allosteric changes in protein conformations can produce large movements by amplifying a small, local conformational change. As will be discussed in Chapter 6, EF-Tu is an abundant molecule that serves as an elongation factor (hence the EF) in protein synthesis, loading each aminoacyl-tRNA molecule onto the ribosome. EF-Tu contains a Ras-like domain (see Figure 3–67), and the tRNA molecule forms a tight complex with its GTP-bound form. This tRNA molecule can transfer its amino acid to the growing polypeptide chain only after the GTP bound to EF-Tu is hydrolyzed, dissociating the EF-Tu. Since this GTP hydrolysis is triggered by a proper fit of the tRNA to the mRNA molecule on the ribosome, the EF-Tu serves as a factor that discriminates between correct and incorrect mRNA–tRNA pairings (see Figure 6–65).</voice>

The dissociation of the inorganic phosphate group (Pi), which follows the reaction GTP → GDP + Pi, causes a shift of a few tenths of a nanometer at the GTP-binding site, just as it does in the Ras protein. This tiny movement, equivalent to a few times the diameter of a hydrogen atom, causes a conformational change to propagate along a crucial piece of α helix, called the switch helix, in the Ras-like domain of the protein. The switch helix seems to serve as a latch that adheres to a specific site in another domain of the molecule, holding the protein in a “shut” conformation. The conformational change triggered by GTP hydrolysis causes the switch helix to detach, allowing separate domains of the protein to swing apart, through a distance of about 4 nm (Figure 3–72). This releases the bound tRNA molecule, allowing its attached amino acid to be used (Figure 3–73).</voice>

Dramatic shape changes of this type also cause the very large movements that occur in motor proteins, as we discuss next.</voice>
