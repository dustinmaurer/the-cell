Humans Report on Their Own Peculiarities

00:00:03,437 --> 00:00:56,625
As humans, we have a special interest in the human genome. We want to know the full set of parts from which we are made, and to discover how they work. But even if you were a mouse, preoccupied with the molecular biology of mice, humans would be attractive as model genetic organisms, because of one special property: through medical examinations and self-reporting, we catalog our own genetic (and other) disorders. The human population is enormous, consisting today of some 7 billion individuals, and this self-documenting property means that a huge database of information exists on human mutations. The human genome sequence of more than 3 billion nucleotide pairs has been determined for thousands of different people, making it easier than ever before to identify at a molecular level the precise genetic change responsible for any given human mutant phenotype.

By drawing together the insights from humans, mice, fish, flies, worms, yeasts, plants, and bacteria—using gene sequence similarities to map out the correspondences between one model organism and another—we are enriching our understanding of them all.

We Are All Different in Detail

What precisely do we mean when we speak of the human genome? Whose genome? On average, any two people taken at random differ in about one or two in every 1000 nucleotide pairs in their DNA sequence. The genome of the human species is, properly speaking, a very complex thing, embracing the entire pool of variant genes found in the human population. Knowledge of this variation is helping us to understand, for example, why some people are prone to one disease, others to another; why some respond well to a drug, others badly. It is also providing clues to our history—the population movements and minglings of our ancestors, the infections they suffered, the diets they ate. All these things have left traces in the variant forms of genes that survive today in the human communities that populate the globe.

To Understand Cells and Organisms Will Require Mathematics, Computers, and Quantitative Information

7
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:50,625
Empowered by knowledge of complete genome sequences, we can list the genes, proteins, and RNA molecules in a cell, and we have methods that allow us to begin to depict the complex web of interactions between them. But how are we to turn all this information into an understanding of how cells work? Even for a single cell type belonging to a single species of organism, the current deluge of data seems overwhelming. The sort of informal reasoning on which biologists usually rely seems totally inadequate in the face of such complexity.
