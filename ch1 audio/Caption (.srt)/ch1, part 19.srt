Genes Can Be Transferred Between Organisms, Both in the Laboratory and in Nature

Prokaryotes provide good examples of the horizontal transfer of genes from one species of cell to another. The most obvious tell-tale signs are sequences recognizable as being derived from viruses, those infecting bacteria being called bacteriophages (Figure 1–22). Viruses are small packets of genetic material that have evolved as parasites on the reproductive and biosynthetic machinery of host cells. Although not themselves living cells, they often serve as vectors for gene transfer. A virus will replicate in one cell, emerge from it with a protective wrapping, and then enter and infect another cell, which may be of the same or a different species. Often, the infected cell will be killed by the massive proliferation of virus particles inside it; but sometimes, the viral DNA, instead of directly generating these particles, may persist in its host for many cell generations as a relatively innocuous passenger, either as a separate intracellular fragment of DNA, known as a plasmid, or as a sequence inserted into the cell’s regular genome. In their travels, viruses can accidentally pick up fragments of DNA from the genome of one host cell and ferry them into another cell. Such transfers of genetic material are very common in prokaryotes.

Horizontal transfers of genes between eukaryotic cells of different species are very rare, and they do not seem to have played a significant part in eukaryote evolution (although massive transfers from bacterial to eukaryotic genomes have occurred in the evolution of mitochondria and chloroplasts, as we discuss below).

In contrast, horizontal gene transfers occur much more frequently between different species of prokaryotes. Many prokaryotes have a remarkable capacity to take up even nonviral DNA molecules from their surroundings and thereby capture the genetic information these molecules carry. By this route, or by virus-mediated transfer, bacteria and archaea in the wild can acquire genes from neighboring cells relatively easily. Genes that confer resistance to an antibiotic or an ability to produce a toxin, for example, can be transferred from species to species and provide the recipient bacterium with a selective advantage. In this way, new and sometimes dangerous strains of bacteria have been observed to evolve in the bacterial ecosystems that inhabit hospitals or the various niches in the human body. For example, horizontal gene transfer is responsible for the spread, over the past 40 years, of penicillin-resistant strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the bacterium that causes gonorrhea. On a longer time scale, the results can be even more profound; it has been estimated that at least 18% of all of the genes in the present-day genome of E. coli have been acquired by horizontal transfer from another species within the past 100 million years.
