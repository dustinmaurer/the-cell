The precise course of vertebrate genome evolution remains uncertain, because many further evolutionary changes have occurred since these ancient events.

00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:55,275
Genes that were once identical have diverged; many of the gene copies have been lost through disruptive mutations; some have undergone further rounds of local duplication; and the genome, in each branch of the vertebrate family tree, has suffered repeated rearrangements, breaking up most of the original gene orderings. Comparison of the gene order in two related organisms, such as the human and the mouse, reveals that—on the time scale of vertebrate evolution—chromosomes frequently fuse and fragment to move large blocks of DNA sequence around. Indeed, it is possible, as discussed in Chapter 4, that the present state of affairs is the result of many separate duplications of fragments of the genome, rather than duplications of the genome as a whole.

There is, however, no doubt that such whole-genome duplications do occur from time to time in evolution, for we can see recent instances in which duplicated chromosome sets are still clearly identifiable as such. The frog genus Xenopus, for example, comprises a set of closely similar species related to one another by repeated duplications or triplications of the whole genome. Among these frogs are X tropicalis, with an ordinary diploid genome; the common laboratory species X laevis, with a duplicated genome and twice as much DNA per cell; and X ruwenzoriensis, with a sixfold reduplication of the original genome and six times as much DNA per cell (108 chromosomes, compared with 36 in X laevis, for example). These species are estimated to have diverged from one another within the past 120 million years (Figure 1–42).

The Frog and the Zebrafish Provide Accessible Models for Vertebrate Development

00:01:56,975 --> 00:02:25,525
Frogs have long been used to study the early steps of embryonic development in vertebrates, because their eggs are big, easy to manipulate, and fertilized outside of the animal, so that the subsequent development of the early embryo is easily followed (Figure 1–43). Xenopus laevis, in particular, continues to be an important model organism, even though it is poorly suited for genetic analysis (Movie 1.6 and see Movie 21.1).

The zebrafish Danio rerio has similar advantages, but without this drawback. Its genome is compact—only half as big as that of a mouse or a human—and it has a generation time of only about three months. Many mutants are known, and genetic engineering is relatively easy. The zebrafish has the added virtue that it is transparent for the first two weeks of its life, so that one can watch the behavior of individual cells in the living organism (see Movie 21.2). All this has made it an increasingly important model vertebrate (Figure 1–44).
