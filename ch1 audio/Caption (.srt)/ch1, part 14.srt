The Greatest Biochemical Diversity Exists Among Prokaryotic Cells

From simple microscopy, it has long been clear that living organisms can be classified on the basis of cell structure into two groups: the eukaryotes and the prokaryotes. Eukaryotes keep their DNA in a distinct membrane-enclosed intracellular compartment called the nucleus. (The name is from the Greek, meaning “truly nucleated,” from the words eu, “well” or “truly,” and karyon, “kernel” or “nucleus.”) Prokaryotes have no distinct nuclear compartment to house theirDNA. Plants, fungi, and animals are eukaryotes; bacteria are prokaryotes, as are archaea—a separate class of prokaryotic cells, discussed below.

Most prokaryotic cells are small and simple in outward appearance (Figure 1–13), and they live mostly as independent individuals or in loosely organized communities, rather than as multicellular organisms. They are typically spherical or rod-shaped and measure a few micrometers in linear dimension. They often have a tough protective coat, called a cell wall, beneath which a plasma membrane encloses a single cytoplasmic compartment containing DNA, RNA, proteins, and the many small molecules needed for life. In the electron microscope, this cell interior appears as a matrix of varying texture without any discernible organized internal structure (Figure 1–14).

Prokaryotic cells live in an enormous variety of ecological niches, and they are astonishingly varied in their biochemical capabilities—far more so than eukaryotic cells. Organotrophic species can utilize virtually any type of organic molecule as food, from sugars and amino acids to hydrocarbons and methane gas. Phototrophic species (Figure 1–15) harvest light energy in a variety of ways, some of them generating oxygen as a by-product, others not. Lithotrophic species can feed on a plain diet of inorganic nutrients, getting their carbon from CO2, and relying on H2S to fuel their energy needs (Figure 1–16)—or on H2, or Fe2+, or elemental sulfur, or any of a host of other chemicals that occur in the environment.

Much of this world of microscopic organisms is virtually unexplored. Traditional methods of bacteriology have given us an acquaintance with those species that can be isolated and cultured in the laboratory. But DNA sequence analysis of the populations of bacteria and archaea in samples from natural habitats—such as soil or ocean water, or even the human mouth—has opened our eyes to the fact that most species cannot be cultured by standard laboratory techniques. According to one estimate, at least 99% of prokaryotic species remain to be characterized. Detected only by their DNA, it has not yet been possible to grow the vast majority of them in laboratories.
