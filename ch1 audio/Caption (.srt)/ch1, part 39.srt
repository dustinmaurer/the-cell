• What new approaches might provide a clearer view of the anaerobic archaeon that is thought to have formed the nucleus of the first eukaryotic cell? How did its symbiosis with an aerobic bacterium lead to the mitochondrion? Somewhere on Earth, are there cells not yet identified that can fill in the details of how eukaryotic cells originated?

• DNA sequencing has revealed a rich and previously undiscovered world of microbial cells, the vast majority of which fail to grow in a laboratory. How might these cells be made more accessible for detailed study?

• What new model cells or organisms should be developed for scientists to study? Why might a concerted focus on these models speed progress toward understanding a critical aspect of cell function that is poorly understood?
