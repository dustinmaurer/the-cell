Introduction to the cell
Cells and Genomes
The surface of our planet is populated by living things—curious, intricately organized chemical factories that take in matter from their surroundings and use these raw materials to generate copies of themselves. These living organisms appear extraordinarily diverse. What could be more different than a tiger and a piece of seaweed, or a bacterium and a tree? Yet our ancestors, knowing nothing of cells or DNA, saw that all these things had something in common. They called that something “life,” marveled at it, struggled to define it, and despaired of explaining what it was or how it worked in terms that relate to nonliving matter.
The discoveries of the past century have not diminished the marvel—quite the contrary. But they have removed the central mystery regarding the nature of life. We can now see that all living things are made of cells: small, membrane-enclosed units filled with a concentrated aqueous solution of chemicals and endowed with the extraordinary ability to create copies of themselves by growing and then dividing in two.
Because cells are the fundamental units of life, it is to cell biology—the study of the structure, function, and behavior of cells—that we must look for answers to the questions of what life is and how it works. With a deeper understanding of cells and their evolution, we can begin to tackle the grand historical problems of life on Earth: its mysterious origins, its stunning diversity, and its invasion of every conceivable habitat. Indeed, as emphasized long ago by the pioneering cell biologist E. B. Wilson, “the key to every biological problem must finally be sought in the cell; for every living organism is, or at some time has been, a cell.”
Despite their apparent diversity, living things are fundamentally similar inside. The whole of biology is thus a counterpoint between two themes: astonishing variety in individual particulars; astonishing constancy in fundamental mechanisms. In this first chapter, we begin by outlining the universal features common to all life on our planet. We then survey, briefly, the diversity of cells. And we see how, thanks to the common molecular code in which the specifications for all living organisms are written, it is possible to read, measure, and decipher these specifications to help us achieve a coherent understanding of all the forms of life, from the smallest to the greatest.

ch1, part 2,"It is estimated that there are more than 10 million—perhaps 100 million—living species on Earth today. Each species is different, and each reproduces itself faithfully, yielding progeny that belong to the same species: the parent organism hands down information specifying, in extraordinary detail, the characteristics that the offspring shall have. This phenomenon of heredity is central to the definition of life: it distinguishes life from other processes, such as the growth of a crystal, or the burning of a candle, or the formation of waves on water, in which orderly structures are generated but without the same type of link between the peculiarities of parents and the peculiarities of offspring. Like the candle flame, the living organism must consume free energy to create and maintain its organization. But life employs the free energy to drive a hugely complex system of chemical processes that are specified by hereditary information.
Most living organisms are single cells. Others, such as ourselves, are vast multicellular cities in which groups of cells perform specialized functions linked by intricate systems of communication. But even for the aggregate of more than 10 to the 13 cells that form a human body, the whole organism has been generated by cell divisions from a single cell. The single cell, therefore, is the vehicle for all of the hereditary information that defines each species (Figure 1–1). This cell includes the machinery to gather raw materials from the environment and to construct from them a new cell in its own image, complete with a new copy of its hereditary information. Each and every cell is truly amazing.
All Cells Store Their Hereditary Information in the Same Linear Chemical Code: DNA
Computers have made us familiar with the concept of information as a measurable quantity—a million bytes (to record a few hundred pages of text or an image from a digital camera), 600 million bytes for the music on a CD, and so on. Computers have also made us well aware that the same information can be recorded in many different physical forms: the discs and tapes that we used 20 years ago for our electronic archives have become unreadable on present-day machines. Living cells, like computers, store information, and it is estimated that they have been evolving and diversifying for over 3.5 billion years. It is scarcely to be expected that they would all store their information in the same form, or that the archives of one type of cell should be readable by the information-handling machinery of another. And yet it is so. All living cells on Earth store their hereditary information in the form of double-stranded molecules of DNA—long, unbranched, paired polymer chains, formed always of the same four types of monomers. ","<!--ID=B7267351-473F-409D-9765-754A8EBCDE05;Version=1|{""VoiceNameToIdMapItems"":[{""Name"":""Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, ChristopherNeural)"",""ShortName"":""en-US-ChristopherNeural"",""Locale"":""en-US"",""Id"":""4337134d-4e59-48d1-af56-f4e96771bda1"",""VoiceType"":""StandardVoice""}]}-->

ch1, part 3,"These monomers, chemical compounds known as nucleotides, have nicknames drawn from a four-letter alphabet—A, T, C, G—and they are strung together in a long linear sequence that encodes the genetic information, just as the sequence of 1s and 0s encodes the information in a computer file. We can take a piece of DNA from a human cell and insert it into a bacterium, or a piece of bacterial DNA and insert it into a human cell, and the information will be successfully red, interpreted, and copied. Using chemical methods, scientists have learned how to read out the complete sequence of monomers in any DNA molecule—extending for many millions of nucleotides—and thereby decipher all of the hereditary information that each organism contains.
All Cells Replicate Their Hereditary Information by Templated Polymerization
The mechanisms that make life possible depend on the structure of the doublestranded DNA molecule. Each monomer in a single DNA strand—that is, each nucleotide—consists of two parts: a sugar (deoxyribose) with a phosphate group attached to it, and a base, which may be either adenine, A, guanine (G), cytosine (C), or thymine (T) (Figure 1–2). Each sugar is linked to the next via the phosphate group, creating a polymer chain composed of a repetitive sugar-phosphate backbone with a series of bases protruding from it. The DNA polymer is extended by adding monomers at one end. For a single isolated strand, these monomers can, in principle, be added in any order, because each one links to the next in the same way, through the part of the molecule that is the same for all of them. In the living cell, however, DNA is not synthesized as a free strand in isolation, but on a template formed by a preexisting DNA strand. The bases protruding from the existing strand bind to bases of the strand being synthesized, according to a strict rule defined by the complementary structures of the bases: A binds to T, and C binds to G. This base-pairing holds fresh monomers in place and thereby controls the selection of which one of the four monomers shall be added to the growing strand next. In this way, a double-stranded structure is created, consisting of two exactly complementary sequences of A's, C's, T's, and G's. The two strands twist around each other, forming a DNA double helix (Figure 1–2E).","<!--ID=B7267351-473F-409D-9765-754A8EBCDE05;Version=1|{""VoiceNameToIdMapItems"":[{""Name"":""Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, ChristopherNeural)"",""ShortName"":""en-US-ChristopherNeural"",""Locale"":""en-US"",""Id"":""4337134d-4e59-48d1-af56-f4e96771bda1"",""VoiceType"":""StandardVoice""}]}-->

ch1, part 4,"The bonds between the base pairs are weak compared with the sugar-phosphate links, and this allows the two DNA strands to be pulled apart without breakage of their backbones. Each strand then can serve as a template, in the way just described, for the synthesis of a fresh DNA strand complementary to itself—a fresh copy, that is, of the hereditary information (Figure 1–3). In different types of cells, this process of DNA replication occurs at different rates, with different controls to start it or stop it, and different auxiliary molecules to help it along. But the basics are universal: DNA is the information store for heredity, and templated polymerization is the way in which this information is copied throughout the living world.
All Cells Transcribe Portions of Their Hereditary Information into the Same Intermediary Form: RNA
To carry out its information-bearing function, DNA must do more than copy itself. It must also express its information, by letting the information guide the synthesis of other molecules in the cell. This expression occurs by a mechanism that is the same in all living organisms, leading first and foremost to the production of two other key classes of polymers: RNAs and proteins. The process (discussed in detail in Chapters 6 and 7) begins with a templated polymerization called transcription, in which segments of the DNA sequence are used as templates for the synthesis of shorter molecules of the closely related polymer ribonucleic acid, or RNA. Later, in the more complex process of translation, many of these RNA molecules direct the synthesis of polymers of a radically different chemical class—the proteins (Figure 1–4).
In RNA, the backbone is formed of a slightly different sugar from that of DNA—ribose instead of deoxyribose—and one of the four bases is slightly different—uracil (U) in place of thymine (T). But the other three bases—A, C, and G—are the same, and all four bases pair with their complementary counterparts in DNA—the A, U, C, and G of RNA with the T, A, G, and C of DNA. During transcription, the RNA monomers are lined up and selected for polymerization on a template strand of DNA, just as DNA monomers are selected during replication. The outcome is a polymer molecule whose sequence of nucleotides faithfully represents a portion of the cell’s genetic information, even though it is written in a slightly different alphabet—consisting of RNA monomers instead of DNA monomers.
The same segment of DNA can be used repeatedly to guide the synthesis of many identical RNA molecules. Thus, whereas the cell’s archive of genetic information in the form of DNA is fixed and sacrosanct, these RNA transcripts are mass-produced and disposable (Figure 1–5). As we shall see, these transcripts function as intermediates in the transfer of genetic information. Most notably, they serve as messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules that guide the synthesis of proteins according to the genetic instructions stored in the DNA.","<!--ID=B7267351-473F-409D-9765-754A8EBCDE05;Version=1|{""VoiceNameToIdMapItems"":[{""Name"":""Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, ChristopherNeural)"",""ShortName"":""en-US-ChristopherNeural"",""Locale"":""en-US"",""Id"":""4337134d-4e59-48d1-af56-f4e96771bda1"",""VoiceType"":""StandardVoice""}]}-->

ch1, part 5,"RNA molecules have distinctive structures that can also give them other specialized chemical capabilities. Being single-stranded, their backbone is flexible, so that the polymer chain can bend back on itself to allow one part of the molecule to form weak bonds with another part of the same molecule. This occurs when segments of the sequence are locally complementary: a ...GGGG... segment, for example, will tend to associate with a ...CCCC... segment. These types of internal associations can cause an RNA chain to fold up into a specific shape that is dictated by its sequence (Figure 1–6). The shape of the RNA molecule, in turn, may enable it to recognize other molecules by binding to them selectively—and even, in certain cases, to catalyze chemical changes in the molecules that are bound. In fact, some chemical reactions catalyzed by RNA molecules are crucial for several of the most ancient and fundamental processes in living cells, and it has been suggested that an extensive catalysis by RNA played a central part in the early evolution of life (discussed in Chapter 6).
All Cells Use Proteins as Catalysts
Protein molecules, like DNA and RNA molecules, are long unbranched polymer chains, formed by stringing together monomeric building blocks drawn from a standard repertoire that is the same for all living cells. Like DNA and RNA, proteins carry information in the form of a linear sequence of symbols, in the same way as a human message written in an alphabetic script. There are many different protein molecules in each cell, and—leaving out the water—they form most of the cell’s mass.
The monomers of protein, the amino acids, are quite different from those of DNA and RNA, and there are 20 types instead of 4. Each amino acid is built around the same core structure through which it can be linked in a standard way to any other amino acid in the set; attached to this core is a side group that gives each amino acid a distinctive chemical character. Each of the protein molecules is a polypeptide, created by joining its amino acids in a particular sequence. Through billions of years of evolution, this sequence has been selected to give the protein a useful function. Thus, by folding into a precise three-dimensional form with reactive sites on its surface (Figure 1–7A), these amino-acid polymers can bind with high specificity to other molecules and can act as enzymes to catalyze reactions that make or break covalent bonds. In this way they direct the vast majority of chemical processes in the cell (Figure 1–7B).
Proteins have many other functions as well—maintaining structures, generating movements, sensing signals, and so on—each protein molecule performing a specific function according to its own genetically specified sequence of amino acids. Proteins, above all, are the main molecules that put the cell’s genetic information into action.","<!--ID=B7267351-473F-409D-9765-754A8EBCDE05;Version=1|{""VoiceNameToIdMapItems"":[{""Name"":""Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, ChristopherNeural)"",""ShortName"":""en-US-ChristopherNeural"",""Locale"":""en-US"",""Id"":""4337134d-4e59-48d1-af56-f4e96771bda1"",""VoiceType"":""StandardVoice""}]}-->

ch1, part 6,"Thus, polynucleotides specify the amino acid sequences of proteins. Proteins, in turn, catalyze many chemical reactions, including those by which new DNA molecules are synthesized. From the most fundamental point of view, a living cell is a self-replicating collection of catalysts that takes in food, processes this food to derive both the building blocks and energy needed to make more catalysts, and discards the materials left over as waste (Figure 1–8A). A feedback loop that connects proteins and polynucleotides forms the basis for this autocatalytic, selfreproducing behavior of living organisms (Figure 1–8B).
All Cells Translate RNA into Protein in the Same Way
How the information in DNA specifies the production of proteins was a complete mystery in the 1950s when the double-stranded structure of DNA was first revealed as the basis of heredity. But in the intervening years, scientists have discovered the elegant mechanisms involved. The translation of genetic information from the 4-letter alphabet of polynucleotides into the 20-letter alphabet of proteins is a complex process. The rules of this translation seem in some respects neat and rational but in other respects strangely arbitrary, given that they are (with minor exceptions) identical in all living things. These arbitrary features, it is thought, reflect frozen accidents in the early history of life. They stem from the chance properties of the earliest organisms that were passed on by heredity and have become so deeply embedded in the constitution of all living cells that they cannot be changed without disastrous effects.
It turns out that the information in the sequence of a messenger RNA molecule is read out in groups of three nucleotides at a time: each triplet of nucleotides, or codon, specifies (codes for) a single amino acid in a corresponding protein. Since the number of distinct triplets that can be formed from four nucleotides is 4 to the third, there are 64 possible codons, all of which occur in nature. However, there are only 20 naturally occurring amino acids. That means there are necessarily many cases in which several codons correspond to the same amino acid. This genetic code is read out by a special class of small RNA molecules, the transfer RNAs (tRNAs).

Proteins, in turn, catalyze many chemical reactions, including those by which new DNA molecules are synthesized. From the most fundamental point of view, a living cell is a self-replicating collection of catalysts that takes in food, processes this food to derive both the building blocks and energy needed to make more catalysts, and discards the materials left over as waste (Figure 1–8A). A feedback loop that connects proteins and polynucleotides forms the basis for this autocatalytic, selfreproducing behavior of living organisms (Figure 1–8B).</voice>
<voice name=""en-US-ChristopherNeural"">All Cells Translate RNA into Protein in the Same Way</voice>
<voice name=""en-US-ChristopherNeural"">How the information in DNA specifies the production of proteins was a complete mystery in the 1950s when the double-stranded structure of DNA was first revealed as the basis of heredity. But in the intervening years, scientists have discovered the elegant mechanisms involved. The translation of genetic information from the 4-letter alphabet of polynucleotides into the 20-letter alphabet of proteins is a complex process. The rules of this translation seem in some respects neat and rational but in other respects strangely arbitrary, given that they are (with minor exceptions) identical in all living things. These arbitrary features, it is thought, reflect frozen accidents in the early history of life. They stem from the chance properties of the earliest organisms that were passed on by heredity and have become so deeply embedded in the constitution of all living cells that they cannot be changed without disastrous effects.</voice>
<voice name=""en-US-ChristopherNeural"">It turns out that the information in the sequence of a messenger RNA molecule is read out in groups of three nucleotides at a time: each triplet of nucleotides, or codon, specifies (codes for) a single amino acid in a corresponding protein. Since the number of distinct triplets that can be formed from four nucleotides is 4 to the third, there are 64 possible codons, all of which occur in nature. However, there are only 20 naturally occurring amino acids. That means there are necessarily many cases in which several codons correspond to the same amino acid. This genetic code is read out by a special class of small RNA molecules, the transfer RNAs (tRNAs). Each type of tRNA becomes attached at one end to a specific amino acid, and displays at its other end a specific sequence of three nucleotides—an anticodon—that enables it to recognize, through base-pairing, a particular codon or subset of codons in mRNA. The intricate chemistry that enables these tRNAs to translate a specific sequence of A, C, G, and U nucleotides in an mRNA molecule into a specific sequence of amino acids in a protein molecule occurs on the ribosome, a large multimolecular machine composed of both protein and ribosomal RNA. All of these processes are described in detail in Chapter 6.</voice></speak>"
ch1, part 7,"Each Protein Is Encoded by a Specific Gene
DNA molecules as a rule are very large, containing the specifications for thousands of proteins. Special sequences in the DNA serve as punctuation, defining where the information for each protein begins and ends. And individual segments of the long DNA sequence are transcribed into separate mRNA molecules, coding for different proteins. Each such DNA segment represents one gene. A complication is that RNA molecules transcribed from the same DNA segment can often be processed in more than one way, so as to give rise to a set of alternative versions of a protein, especially in more complex cells such as those of plants and animals. In addition, some DNA segments—a smaller number—are transcribed into RNA molecules that are not translated but have catalytic, regulatory, or structural functions; such DNA segments also count as genes. A gene therefore is defined as the segment of DNA sequence corresponding to a single protein or set of alternative protein variants or to a single catalytic, regulatory, or structural RNA molecule.
In all cells, the expression of individual genes is regulated: instead of manufacturing its full repertoire of possible proteins at full tilt all the time, the cell adjusts the rate of transcription and translation of different genes independently, according to need. Stretches of regulatory DNA are interspersed among the segments that code for protein, and these noncoding regions bind to special protein molecules that control the local rate of transcription. The quantity and organization of the regulatory DNA vary widely from one class of organisms to another, but the basic strategy is universal. In this way, the genome of the cell—that is, the totality of its genetic information as embodied in its complete DNA sequence—dictates not only the nature of the cell’s proteins, but also when and where they are to be made.
Life Requires Free Energy
A living cell is a dynamic chemical system, operating far from chemical equilibrium. For a cell to grow or to make a new cell in its own image, it must take in free energy from the environment, as well as raw materials, to drive the necessary synthetic reactions. This consumption of free energy is fundamental to life. When it stops, a cell decays toward chemical equilibrium and soon dies.
Genetic information is also fundamental to life, and free energy is required for the propagation of this information. For example, to specify one bit of information—that is, one yes/no choice between two equally probable alternatives— costs a defined amount of free energy that can be calculated. The quantitative relationship involves some deep reasoning and depends on a precise definition of the term “free energy,” as explained in Chapter 2. The basic idea, however, is not difficult to understand intuitively.","<!--ID=B7267351-473F-409D-9765-754A8EBCDE05;Version=1|{""VoiceNameToIdMapItems"":[{""Name"":""Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, ChristopherNeural)"",""ShortName"":""en-US-ChristopherNeural"",""Locale"":""en-US"",""Id"":""4337134d-4e59-48d1-af56-f4e96771bda1"",""VoiceType"":""StandardVoice""}]}-->

ch1, part 8,"Picture the molecules in a cell as a swarm of objects endowed with thermal energy, moving around violently at random, buffeted by collisions with one another. To specify genetic information—in the form of a DNA sequence, for example—molecules from this wild crowd must be captured, arranged in a specific order defined by some preexisting template, and linked together in a fixed relationship. The bonds that hold the molecules in their proper places on the template and join them together must be strong enough to resist the disordering effect of thermal motion. The process is driven forward by consumption of free energy, which is needed to ensure that the correct bonds are made, and made robustly. In the simplest case, the molecules can be compared with spring-loaded traps, ready to snap into a more stable, lower-energy attached state when they meet their proper partners; as they snap together into the bonded arrangement, their available stored energy—their free energy—like the energy of the spring in the trap, is released and dissipated as heat. In a cell, the chemical processes underlying information transfer are more complex, but the same basic principle applies: free energy has to be spent on the creation of order.
To replicate its genetic information faithfully, and indeed to make all its complex molecules according to the correct specifications, the cell therefore requires free energy, which has to be imported somehow from the surroundings. As we shall see in Chapter 2, the free energy required by animal cells is derived from chemical bonds in food molecules that the animals eat, while plants get their free energy from sunlight.

Because all cells make DNA, RNA, and protein, all cells have to contain and manipulate a similar collection of small molecules, including simple sugars, nucleotides, and amino acids, as well as other substances that are universally required.

Some organisms, such as plants, require only the simplest of nutrients and harness the energy of sunlight to make all their own small organic molecules.

ch1, part 9,"Another universal feature is that each cell is enclosed by a membrane—the plasma membrane. This container acts as a selective barrier that enables the cell to concentrate nutrients gathered from its environment and retain the products it synthesizes for its own use, while excreting its waste products. Without a plasma membrane, the cell could not maintain its integrity as a coordinated chemical system.
The molecules that form a membrane have the simple physicochemical property of being amphiphilic—that is, consisting of one part that is hydrophobic (water-insoluble) and another part that is hydrophilic (water-soluble). Such molecules placed in water aggregate spontaneously, arranging their hydrophobic portions to be as much in contact with one another as possible to hide them from the water, while keeping their hydrophilic portions exposed. Amphiphilic molecules of appropriate shape, such as the phospholipid molecules that comprise most of the plasma membrane, spontaneously aggregate in water to create a bilayer that forms small closed vesicles (Figure 1–9). The phenomenon can be demonstrated in a test tube by simply mixing phospholipids and water together; under appropriate conditions, small vesicles form whose aqueous contents are isolated from the external medium.
Although the chemical details vary, the hydrophobic tails of the predominant membrane molecules in all cells are hydrocarbon polymers (–CH2–CH2–CH2–), and their spontaneous assembly into a bilayered vesicle is but one of many examples of an important general principle: cells produce molecules whose chemical properties cause them to self-assemble into the structures that a cell needs.
The cell boundary cannot be totally impermeable. If a cell is to grow and reproduce, it must be able to import raw materials and export waste across its plasma membrane.

ch1, part 10,"A Living Cell Can Exist with Fewer Than 500 Genes
The basic principles of biological information transfer are simple enough, but how complex are real living cells? In particular, what are the minimum requirements? We can get a rough indication by considering a species that has one of the smallest known genomes—the bacterium Mycoplasma genitalium (Figure 1–10). This organism lives as a parasite in mammals, and its environment provides it with many of its small molecules ready-made. Nevertheless, it still has to make all the large molecules—DNA, RNAs, and proteins—required for the basic processes of heredity. It has about 530 genes, about 400 of which are essential. Its genome of 580,070 nucleotide pairs represents 145,018 bytes of information—about as much as it takes to record the text of one chapter of this book. Cell biology may be complicated, but it is not impossibly so.
The minimum number of genes for a viable cell in today’s environments is probably not less than 300, although there are only about 60 genes in the core set that is shared by all living species.
Summary
The individual cell is the minimal self-reproducing unit of living matter, and it consists of a self-replicating collection of catalysts. Central to this reproduction is the transmission of genetic information to progeny cells. Every cell on our planet stores its genetic information in the same chemical form—as double-stranded DNA. The cell replicates its information by separating the paired DNA strands and using each as a template for polymerization to make a new DNA strand with a complementary sequence of nucleotides. The same strategy of templated polymerization is used to transcribe portions of the information from DNA into molecules of the closely related polymer, RNA. These RNA molecules in turn guide the synthesis of protein molecules by the more complex machinery of translation, involving a large multimolecular machine, the ribosome. Proteins are the principal catalysts for almost all the chemical reactions in the cell; their other functions include the selective import and export of small molecules across the plasma membrane that forms the cell’s boundary. The specific function of each protein depends on its amino acid sequence, which is specified by the nucleotide sequence of a corresponding segment of the DNA—the gene that codes for that protein. In this way, the genome of the cell determines its chemistry; and the chemistry of every living cell is fundamentally similar, because it must provide for the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and protein. The simplest known cells can survive with about 400 genes.","<!--ID=B7267351-473F-409D-9765-754A8EBCDE05;Version=1|{""VoiceNameToIdMapItems"":[{""Name"":""Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, ChristopherNeural)"",""ShortName"":""en-US-ChristopherNeural"",""Locale"":""en-US"",""Id"":""4337134d-4e59-48d1-af56-f4e96771bda1"",""VoiceType"":""StandardVoice""}]}-->

ch1, part 11,"The Diversity of Genomes and the Tree of Life
The success of living organisms based on DNA, RNA, and protein has been spectacular. Life has populated the oceans, covered the land, infiltrated the Earth’s crust, and molded the surface of our planet. Our oxygen-rich atmosphere, the deposits of coal and oil, the layers of iron ores, the cliffs of chalk and limestone and marble—all these are products, directly or indirectly, of past biological activity on Earth.
Living things are not confined to the familiar temperate realm of land, water, and sunlight inhabited by plants and plant-eating animals. They can be found in the darkest depths of the ocean, in hot volcanic mud, in pools beneath the frozen surface of the Antarctic, and buried kilometers deep in the Earth’s crust. The creatures that live in these extreme environments are generally unfamiliar, not only because they are inaccessible, but also because they are mostly microscopic. In more homely habitats, too, most organisms are too small for us to see without special equipment: they tend to go unnoticed, unless they cause a disease or rot the timbers of our houses. Yet microorganisms make up most of the total mass of living matter on our planet. Only recently, through new methods of molecular analysis and specifically through the analysis of DNA sequences, have we begun to get a picture of life on Earth that is not grossly distorted by our biased perspective as large animals living on dry land.

<voice name=""en-US-ChristopherNeural"">The success of living organisms based on DNA, RNA, and protein has been spectacular. Life has populated the oceans, covered the land, infiltrated the Earth’s crust, and molded the surface of our planet. Our oxygen-rich atmosphere, the deposits of coal and oil, the layers of iron ores, the cliffs of chalk and limestone and marble—all these are products, directly or indirectly, of past biological activity on Earth.</voice>
<voice name=""en-US-ChristopherNeural"">Living things are not confined to the familiar temperate realm of land, water, and sunlight inhabited by plants and plant-eating animals. They can be found in the darkest depths of the ocean, in hot volcanic mud, in pools beneath the frozen surface of the Antarctic, and buried kilometers deep in the Earth’s crust. The creatures that live in these extreme environments are generally unfamiliar, not only because they are inaccessible, but also because they are mostly microscopic. In more homely habitats, too, most organisms are too small for us to see without special equipment: they tend to go unnoticed, unless they cause a disease or rot the timbers of our houses. Yet microorganisms make up most of the total mass of living matter on our planet. Only recently, through new methods of molecular analysis and specifically through the analysis of DNA sequences, have we begun to get a picture of life on Earth that is not grossly distorted by our biased perspective as large animals living on dry land.</voice>

ch1, part 12,"Cells Can Be Powered by a Variety of Free-Energy Sources
Living organisms obtain their free energy in different ways. Some, such as animals, fungi, and the many different bacteria that live in the human gut, get it by feeding on other living things or the organic chemicals they produce; such organisms are called organotrophic (from the Greek word trophe, meaning “food”). Others derive their energy directly from the nonliving world. These primary energy converters fall into two classes: those that harvest the energy of sunlight, and those that capture their energy from energy-rich systems of inorganic chemicals in the environment (chemical systems that are far from chemical equilibrium). Organisms of the former class are called phototrophic (feeding on sunlight); those of the latter are called lithotrophic (feeding on rock). Organotrophic organisms could not exist without these primary energy converters, which are the most plentiful form of life.
Phototrophic organisms include many types of bacteria, as well as algae and plants, on which we—and virtually all the living things that we ordinarily see around us—depend. Phototrophic organisms have changed the whole chemistry of our environment: the oxygen in the Earth’s atmosphere is a by-product of their biosynthetic activities.
Lithotrophic organisms are not such an obvious feature of our world, because they are microscopic and mostly live in habitats that humans do not frequent—deep in the ocean, buried in the Earth’s crust, or in various other inhospitable environments. But they are a major part of the living world, and they are especially important in any consideration of the history of life on Earth.
Some lithotrophs get energy from aerobic reactions, which use molecular oxygen from the environment; since atmospheric O2 is ultimately the product of living organisms, these aerobic lithotrophs are, in a sense, feeding on the products of past life. There are, however, other lithotrophs that live anaerobically, in places where little or no molecular oxygen is present. These are circumstances similar to those that existed in the early days of life on Earth, before oxygen had accumulated.","<!--ID=B7267351-473F-409D-9765-754A8EBCDE05;Version=1|{""VoiceNameToIdMapItems"":[{""Name"":""Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, ChristopherNeural)"",""ShortName"":""en-US-ChristopherNeural"",""Locale"":""en-US"",""Id"":""4337134d-4e59-48d1-af56-f4e96771bda1"",""VoiceType"":""StandardVoice""}]}-->

ch1, part 13,"The most dramatic of these sites are the hot hydrothermal vents on the floor of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. They are located where the ocean floor is spreading as new portions of the Earth’s crust form by a gradual upwelling of material from the Earth’s interior (Figure 1–11). Downward-percolating seawater is heated and driven back upward as a submarine geyser, carrying with it a current of chemicals from the hot rocks below. A typical cocktail might include H2S, H2, CO, Mn2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, CH2, NH4+, and phosphorus-containing compounds. A dense population of microbes lives in the neighborhood of the vent, thriving on this austere diet and harvesting free energy from reactions between the available chemicals. Other organisms—clams, mussels, and giant marine worms—in turn live off the microbes at the vent, forming an entire ecosystem analogous to the world of plants and animals that we belong to, but powered by geochemical energy instead of light (Figure 1–12).
Some Cells Fix Nitrogen and Carbon Dioxide for Others
To make a living cell requires matter, as well as free energy. DNA, RNA, and protein are composed of just six elements: hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus. These are all plentiful in the nonliving environment, in the Earth’s rocks, water, and atmosphere. But they are not present in chemical forms that allow easy incorporation into biological molecules. Atmospheric N2 and CO2, in particular, are extremely unreactive. A large amount of free energy is required to drive the reactions that use these inorganic molecules to make the organic compounds needed for further biosynthesis—that is, to fix nitrogen and carbon dioxide, so as to make N and C available to living organisms. Many types of living cells lack the biochemical machinery to achieve this fixation; they instead rely on other classes of cells to do the job for them. We animals depend on plants for our supplies of organic carbon and nitrogen compounds. Plants in turn, although they can fix carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, lack the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen; they depend in part on nitrogen-fixing bacteria to supply their need for nitrogen compounds. Plants of the pea family, for example, harbor symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria in nodules in their roots.
Living cells therefore differ widely in some of the most basic aspects of their biochemistry. Not surprisingly, cells with complementary needs and capabilities have developed close associations. Some of these associations, as we see below, have evolved to the point where the partners have lost their separate identities altogether: they have joined forces to form a single composite cell.","<!--ID=B7267351-473F-409D-9765-754A8EBCDE05;Version=1|{""VoiceNameToIdMapItems"":[{""Name"":""Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, ChristopherNeural)"",""ShortName"":""en-US-ChristopherNeural"",""Locale"":""en-US"",""Id"":""4337134d-4e59-48d1-af56-f4e96771bda1"",""VoiceType"":""StandardVoice""}]}-->

ch1, part 14,"The Greatest Biochemical Diversity Exists Among Prokaryotic Cells
From simple microscopy, it has long been clear that living organisms can be classified on the basis of cell structure into two groups: the eukaryotes and the prokaryotes. Eukaryotes keep their DNA in a distinct membrane-enclosed intracellular compartment called the nucleus. (The name is from the Greek, meaning “truly nucleated,” from the words eu, “well” or “truly,” and karyon, “kernel” or “nucleus.”) Prokaryotes have no distinct nuclear compartment to house theirDNA. Plants, fungi, and animals are eukaryotes; bacteria are prokaryotes, as are archaea—a separate class of prokaryotic cells, discussed below.
Most prokaryotic cells are small and simple in outward appearance (Figure 1–13), and they live mostly as independent individuals or in loosely organized communities, rather than as multicellular organisms. They are typically spherical or rod-shaped and measure a few micrometers in linear dimension. They often have a tough protective coat, called a cell wall, beneath which a plasma membrane encloses a single cytoplasmic compartment containing DNA, RNA, proteins, and the many small molecules needed for life. In the electron microscope, this cell interior appears as a matrix of varying texture without any discernible organized internal structure (Figure 1–14).
Prokaryotic cells live in an enormous variety of ecological niches, and they are astonishingly varied in their biochemical capabilities—far more so than eukaryotic cells. Organotrophic species can utilize virtually any type of organic molecule as food, from sugars and amino acids to hydrocarbons and methane gas. Phototrophic species (Figure 1–15) harvest light energy in a variety of ways, some of them generating oxygen as a by-product, others not. Lithotrophic species can feed on a plain diet of inorganic nutrients, getting their carbon from CO2, and relying on H2S to fuel their energy needs (Figure 1–16)—or on H2, or Fe2+, or elemental sulfur, or any of a host of other chemicals that occur in the environment. 
Much of this world of microscopic organisms is virtually unexplored. Traditional methods of bacteriology have given us an acquaintance with those species that can be isolated and cultured in the laboratory. But DNA sequence analysis of the populations of bacteria and archaea in samples from natural habitats—such as soil or ocean water, or even the human mouth—has opened our eyes to the fact that most species cannot be cultured by standard laboratory techniques. According to one estimate, at least 99% of prokaryotic species remain to be characterized.

ch1, part 15,"The Tree of Life Has Three Primary Branches: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryotes
The classification of living things has traditionally depended on comparisons of their outward appearances: we can see that a fish has eyes, jaws, backbone, brain, and so on, just as we do, and that a worm does not; that a rosebush is cousin to an apple tree, but is less similar to a grass. As Darwin showed, we can readily interpret such close family resemblances in terms of evolution from common ancestors, and we can find the remains of many of these ancestors preserved in the fossil record. In this way, it has been possible to begin to draw a family tree of living organisms, showing the various lines of descent, as well as branch points in the history, where the ancestors of one group of species became different from those of another.
When the disparities between organisms become very great, however, these methods begin to fail. How do we decide whether a fungus is closer kin to a plant or to an animal? When it comes to prokaryotes, the task becomes harder still: one microscopic rod or sphere looks much like another. Microbiologists have therefore sought to classify prokaryotes in terms of their biochemistry and nutritional requirements. But this approach also has its pitfalls. Amid the bewildering variety of biochemical behaviors, it is difficult to know which differences truly reflect differences of evolutionary history.
Genome analysis has now given us a simpler, more direct, and much more powerful way to determine evolutionary relationships. The complete DNA sequence of an organism defines its nature with almost perfect precision and in exhaustive detail. Moreover, this specification is in a digital form—a string of letters—that can be entered straightforwardly into a computer and compared with the corresponding information for any other living thing. Because DNA is subject to random changes that accumulate over long periods of time (as we shall see shortly), the number of differences between the DNA sequences of two organisms can provide a direct, objective, quantitative indication of the evolutionary distance between them.
This approach has shown that the organisms that were traditionally classed together as “bacteria” can be as widely divergent in their evolutionary origins as is any prokaryote from any eukaryote. It is now clear that the prokaryotes comprise two distinct groups that diverged early in the history of life on Earth, before the eukaryotes diverged as a separate group. The two groups of prokaryotes are called the bacteria (or eubacteria) and the archaea (or archaebacteria). Detailed genome analyses have recently revealed that the first eukayotic cell formed after a particular type of ancient archaeal cell engulfed an ancient bacterium (see Figure 12–3).

In outward appearance they are not easily distinguished from bacteria. At a molecular level, archaea seem to resemble eukaryotes more closely in their machinery for handling genetic information (replication, transcription, and translation), but bacteria more closely in their apparatus for metabolism and energy conversion. We discuss below how this might be explained.
Some Genes Evolve Rapidly; Others Are Highly Conserved
Both in the storage and in the copying of genetic information, random accidents and errors occur, altering the nucleotide sequence—that is, creating mutations. Therefore, when a cell divides, its two daughters are often not quite identical to one another or to their parent. On rare occasions, the error may represent a change for the better; more probably, it will cause no significant difference in the cell’s prospects. But in many cases, the error will cause serious damage—for example, by disrupting the coding sequence for a key protein. Changes due to mistakes of the first type will tend to be perpetuated, because the altered cell has an increased likelihood of reproducing itself. Changes due to mistakes of the second type—selectively neutral changes—may be perpetuated or not: in the competition for limited resources, it is a matter of chance whether the altered cell or its cousins will succeed. But changes that cause serious damage lead nowhere: the cell that suffers them dies, leaving no progeny. Through endless repetition of this cycle of error and trial—of mutation and natural selection—organisms evolve: their genetic specifications change, giving them new ways to exploit the environment more effectively, to survive in competition with others, and to reproduce successfully.
Some parts of the genome will change more easily than others in the course of evolution. A segment of DNA that does not code for protein and has no significant regulatory role is free to change at a rate limited only by the frequency of random errors. In contrast, a gene that codes for a highly optimized essential protein or RNA molecule cannot alter so easily: when mistakes occur, the faulty cells are almost always eliminated. Genes of this latter sort are therefore highly conserved. Through 3.5 billion years or more of evolutionary history, many features of the genome have changed beyond all recognition, but the most highly conserved genes remain perfectly recognizable in all living species.","<!--ID=B7267351-473F-409D-9765-754A8EBCDE05;Version=1|{""VoiceNameToIdMapItems"":[{""Name"":""Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, ChristopherNeural)"",""ShortName"":""en-US-ChristopherNeural"",""Locale"":""en-US"",""Id"":""4337134d-4e59-48d1-af56-f4e96771bda1"",""VoiceType"":""StandardVoice""}]}-->

A segment of DNA that does not code for protein and has no significant regulatory role is free to change at a rate limited only by the frequency of random errors. In contrast, a gene that codes for a highly optimized essential protein or RNA molecule cannot alter so easily: when mistakes occur, the faulty cells are almost always eliminated. Genes of this latter sort are therefore highly conserved. Through 3.5 billion years or more of evolutionary history, many features of the genome have changed beyond all recognition, but the most highly conserved genes remain perfectly recognizable in all living species.</voice></speak>"
ch1, part 17,"These latter genes are the ones we must examine if we wish to trace family relationships between the most distantly related organisms in the tree of life. The initial studies that led to the classification of the living world into the three domains of bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes were based chiefly on analysis of one of the rRNA components of the ribosome. Because the translation of RNA into protein is fundamental to all living cells, this component of the ribosome has been very well conserved since early in the history of life on Earth (Figure 1–18).
Most Bacteria and Archaea Have 1000–6,000 Genes
Natural selection has generally favored those prokaryotic cells that can reproduce the fastest by taking up raw materials from their environment and replicating themselves most efficiently, at the maximal rate permitted by the available food supplies. Small size implies a large ratio of surface area to volume, thereby helping to maximize the uptake of nutrients across the plasma membrane and boosting a cell’s reproductive rate.
Presumably for these reasons, most prokaryotic cells carry very little superfluous baggage; their genomes are small, with genes packed closely together and minimal quantities of regulatory DNA between them. The small genome size has made it easy to use modern DNA sequencing techniques to determine complete genome sequences. We now have this information for thousands of species of bacteria and archaea, as well as for hundreds of species of eukaryotes.

A complete DNA sequence reveals both the genes an organism possesses and the genes it lacks.

To explain the findings, however, we need to consider a little more closely how new genes arise and genomes evolve.
New Genes Are Generated from Preexisting Genes
The raw material of evolution is the DNA sequence that already exists: there is no natural mechanism for making long stretches of new random sequence. In this sense, no gene is ever entirely new. Innovation can, however, occur in several ways (Figure 1–19):
1. Intragenic mutation: an existing gene can be randomly modified by changes in its DNA sequence, through various types of error that occur mainly in the process of DNA replication.
2. Gene duplication: an existing gene can be accidentally duplicated so as to create a pair of initially identical genes within a single cell; these two genes may then diverge in the course of evolution.
3. DNA segment shuffling: two or more existing genes can break and rejoin to make a hybrid gene consisting of DNA segments that originally belonged to separate genes.","<!--ID=B7267351-473F-409D-9765-754A8EBCDE05;Version=1|{""VoiceNameToIdMapItems"":[{""Name"":""Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, ChristopherNeural)"",""ShortName"":""en-US-ChristopherNeural"",""Locale"":""en-US"",""Id"":""4337134d-4e59-48d1-af56-f4e96771bda1"",""VoiceType"":""StandardVoice""}]}-->

Gene Duplications Give Rise to Families of Related Genes Within a Single Cell
A cell duplicates its entire genome each time it divides into two daughter cells. However, accidents occasionally result in the inappropriate duplication of just part of the genome, with retention of original and duplicate segments in a single cell. Once a gene has been duplicated in this way, one of the two gene copies is free to mutate and become specialized to perform a different function within the same cell. Repeated rounds of this process of duplication and divergence, over many millions of years, have enabled one gene to give rise to a family of genes that may all be found within a single genome. Analysis of the DNA sequence of prokaryotic genomes reveals many examples of such gene families: in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, for example, 47% of the genes have one or more obvious relatives (Figure 1–20).
When genes duplicate and diverge in this way, the individuals of one species become endowed with multiple variants of a primordial gene. This evolutionary process has to be distinguished from the genetic divergence that occurs when one species of organism splits into two separate lines of descent at a branch point in the family tree—when the human line of descent became separate from that of chimpanzees, for example. There, the genes gradually become different in the course of evolution, but they are likely to continue to have corresponding functions in the two sister species. Genes that are related by descent in this way—that is, genes in two separate species that derive from the same ancestral gene in the last common ancestor of those two species—are called orthologs. Related genes that have resulted from a gene duplication event within a single genome—and are likely to have diverged in their function—are called paralogs. Genes that are related by descent in either way are called homologs, a general term used to cover both types of relationship (Figure 1–21).","<!--ID=B7267351-473F-409D-9765-754A8EBCDE05;Version=1|{""VoiceNameToIdMapItems"":[{""Name"":""Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, ChristopherNeural)"",""ShortName"":""en-US-ChristopherNeural"",""Locale"":""en-US"",""Id"":""4337134d-4e59-48d1-af56-f4e96771bda1"",""VoiceType"":""StandardVoice""}]}-->

ch1, part 19,"Genes Can Be Transferred Between Organisms, Both in the Laboratory and in Nature 
Prokaryotes provide good examples of the horizontal transfer of genes from one species of cell to another. The most obvious tell-tale signs are sequences recognizable as being derived from viruses, those infecting bacteria being called bacteriophages (Figure 1–22). Viruses are small packets of genetic material that have evolved as parasites on the reproductive and biosynthetic machinery of host cells. Although not themselves living cells, they often serve as vectors for gene transfer. A virus will replicate in one cell, emerge from it with a protective wrapping, and then enter and infect another cell, which may be of the same or a different species. Often, the infected cell will be killed by the massive proliferation of virus particles inside it; but sometimes, the viral DNA, instead of directly generating these particles, may persist in its host for many cell generations as a relatively innocuous passenger, either as a separate intracellular fragment of DNA, known as a plasmid, or as a sequence inserted into the cell’s regular genome. In their travels, viruses can accidentally pick up fragments of DNA from the genome of one host cell and ferry them into another cell. Such transfers of genetic material are very common in prokaryotes.
Horizontal transfers of genes between eukaryotic cells of different species are very rare, and they do not seem to have played a significant part in eukaryote evolution (although massive transfers from bacterial to eukaryotic genomes have occurred in the evolution of mitochondria and chloroplasts, as we discuss below).
In contrast, horizontal gene transfers occur much more frequently between different species of prokaryotes. Many prokaryotes have a remarkable capacity to take up even nonviral DNA molecules from their surroundings and thereby capture the genetic information these molecules carry. By this route, or by virus-mediated transfer, bacteria and archaea in the wild can acquire genes from neighboring cells relatively easily. Genes that confer resistance to an antibiotic or an ability to produce a toxin, for example, can be transferred from species to species and provide the recipient bacterium with a selective advantage. In this way, new and sometimes dangerous strains of bacteria have been observed to evolve in the bacterial ecosystems that inhabit hospitals or the various niches in the human body. For example, horizontal gene transfer is responsible for the spread, over the past 40 years, of penicillin-resistant strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the bacterium that causes gonorrhea. On a longer time scale, the results can be even more profound; it has been estimated that at least 18% of all of the genes in the present-day genome of E. coli have been acquired by horizontal transfer from another species within the past 100 million years.","<!--ID=B7267351-473F-409D-9765-754A8EBCDE05;Version=1|{""VoiceNameToIdMapItems"":[{""Name"":""Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, ChristopherNeural)"",""ShortName"":""en-US-ChristopherNeural"",""Locale"":""en-US"",""Id"":""4337134d-4e59-48d1-af56-f4e96771bda1"",""VoiceType"":""StandardVoice""}]}-->

ch1, part 20,"Sex Results in Horizontal Exchanges of Genetic Information Within a Species
Horizontal gene transfer among prokaryotes has a parallel in a phenomenon familiar to us all: sex. In addition to the usual vertical transfer of genetic material from parent to offspring, sexual reproduction causes a large-scale horizontal transfer of genetic information between two initially separate cell lineages—those of the father and the mother. A key feature of sex, of course, is that the genetic exchange normally occurs only between individuals of the same species. But no matter whether they occur within a species or between species, horizontal gene transfers leave a characteristic imprint: they result in individuals who are related more closely to one set of relatives with respect to some genes, and more closely to another set of relatives with respect to others. By comparing the DNA sequences of individual human genomes, an intelligent visitor from outer space could deducethat humans reproduce sexually, even if it knew nothing about human behavior.
Sexual reproduction is widespread (although not universal), especially among eukaryotes. Even bacteria indulge from time to time in controlled sexual exchanges of DNA with other members of their own species. Natural selection has clearly favored organisms that can reproduce sexually, although evolutionary theorists dispute precisely what that selective advantage is.
The Function of a Gene Can Often Be Deduced from Its Sequence
Family relationships among genes are important not just for their historical interest, but because they simplify the task of deciphering gene functions. Once the sequence of a newly discovered gene has been determined, a scientist can tap a few keys on a computer to search the entire database of known gene sequences for genes related to it. In many cases, the function of one or more of these homologs will have been already determined experimentally. Since gene sequence determines gene function, one can frequently make a good guess at the function of the new gene: it is likely to be similar to that of the already known homologs.
In this way, it is possible to decipher a great deal of the biology of an organism simply by analyzing the DNA sequence of its genome and using the information we already have about the functions of genes in other organisms that have been more intensively studied.","<!--ID=B7267351-473F-409D-9765-754A8EBCDE05;Version=1|{""VoiceNameToIdMapItems"":[{""Name"":""Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, ChristopherNeural)"",""ShortName"":""en-US-ChristopherNeural"",""Locale"":""en-US"",""Id"":""4337134d-4e59-48d1-af56-f4e96771bda1"",""VoiceType"":""StandardVoice""}]}-->

ch1, part 21,"More Than 200 Gene Families Are Common to All Three Primary Branches of the Tree of Life
Given the complete genome sequences of representative organisms from all three domains—archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes—we can search systematically for homologies that span this enormous evolutionary divide. In this way we can begin to take stock of the common inheritance of all living things. There are considerable difficulties in this enterprise. For example, individual species have often lost some of the ancestral genes; other genes have almost certainly been acquired by horizontal transfer from another species and therefore are not truly ancestral, even though shared. In fact, genome comparisons strongly suggest that both lineage-specific gene loss and horizontal gene transfer, in some cases between evolutionarily distant species, have been major factors of evolution, at least among prokaryotes. Finally, in the course of 2 or 3 billion years, some genes that were initially shared will have changed beyond recognition through mutation.
Because of all these vagaries of the evolutionary process, it seems that only a small proportion of ancestral gene families has been universally retained in a recognizable form. Thus, out of 4873 protein-coding gene families defined by comparing the genomes of 50 species of bacteria, 13 archaea, and 3 unicellular eukaryotes, only 63 are truly ubiquitous (that is, represented in all the genomes analyzed). The great majority of these universal families include components of the translation and transcription systems. This is not likely to be a realistic approximation of an ancestral gene set. A better—though still crude—idea of the latter can be obtained by tallying the gene families that have representatives in multiple, but not necessarily all, species from all three major domains. Such an analysis reveals 264 ancient conserved families. Each family can be assigned a function (at least in terms of general biochemical activity, but usually with more precision). As shown in Table 1–1, the largest number of shared gene families are involved in translation and in amino acid metabolism and transport. However, this set of highly conserved gene families represents only a very rough sketch of the common inheritance of all modern life. A more precise reconstruction of the gene complement of the last universal common ancestor will hopefully become feasible with further genome sequencing and more sophisticated forms of comparative analysis.","<!--ID=B7267351-473F-409D-9765-754A8EBCDE05;Version=1|{""VoiceNameToIdMapItems"":[{""Name"":""Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, ChristopherNeural)"",""ShortName"":""en-US-ChristopherNeural"",""Locale"":""en-US"",""Id"":""4337134d-4e59-48d1-af56-f4e96771bda1"",""VoiceType"":""StandardVoice""}]}-->

ch1, part 22,"Mutations Reveal the Functions of Genes
Without additional information, no amount of gazing at genome sequences will reveal the functions of genes. We may recognize that gene B is like gene A, but how do we discover the function of gene A in the first place? And even if we know the function of gene A, how do we test whether the function of gene B is truly the same as the sequence similarity suggests? How do we connect the world of abstract genetic information with the world of real living organisms?
The analysis of gene functions depends on two complementary approaches: genetics and biochemistry. Genetics starts with the study of mutants: we either find or make an organism in which a gene is altered, and then examine the effects on the organism’s structure and performance (Figure 1–23). Biochemistry more directly examines the functions of molecules: here we extract molecules from an organism and then study their chemical activities. By combining genetics and biochemistry, it is possible to find those molecules whose production depends on a given gene. At the same time, careful studies of the performance of the mutant organism show us what role those molecules have in the operation of the organism as a whole. Thus, genetics and biochemistry used in combination with cell biology provide the best way to relate genes and molecules to the structure and function of an organism.
In recent years, DNA sequence information and the powerful tools of molecular biology have accelerated progress. From sequence comparisons, we can often identify particular subregions within a gene that have been preserved nearly unchanged over the course of evolution. These conserved subregions are likely to be the most important parts of the gene in terms of function. We can test their individual contributions to the activity of the gene product by creating in the laboratory mutations of specific sites within the gene, or by constructing artificial hybrid genes that combine part of one gene with part of another. Organisms can be engineered to make either the RNA or the protein specified by the gene in large quantities to facilitate biochemical analysis. Specialists in molecular structure can determine the three-dimensional conformation of the gene product, revealing the exact position of every atom in it. Biochemists can determine how each of the parts of the genetically specified molecule contributes to its chemical behavior.

<voice name=""en-US-ChristopherNeural"">Without additional information, no amount of gazing at genome sequences will reveal the functions of genes. We may recognize that gene B is like gene A, but how do we discover the function of gene A in the first place? And even if we know the function of gene A, how do we test whether the function of gene B is truly the same as the sequence similarity suggests? How do we connect the world of abstract genetic information with the world of real living organisms?</voice>
<voice name=""en-US-ChristopherNeural"">The analysis of gene functions depends on two complementary approaches: genetics and biochemistry. Genetics starts with the study of mutants: we either find or make an organism in which a gene is altered, and then examine the effects on the organism’s structure and performance (Figure 1–23). Biochemistry more directly examines the functions of molecules: here we extract molecules from an organism and then study their chemical activities. By combining genetics and biochemistry, it is possible to find those molecules whose production depends on a given gene. At the same time, careful studies of the performance of the mutant organism show us what role those molecules have in the operation of the organism as a whole. Thus, genetics and biochemistry used in combination with cell biology provide the best way to relate genes and molecules to the structure and function of an organism.</voice>
<voice name=""en-US-ChristopherNeural"">In recent years, DNA sequence information and the powerful tools of molecular biology have accelerated progress. From sequence comparisons, we can often identify particular subregions within a gene that have been preserved nearly unchanged over the course of evolution. These conserved subregions are likely to be the most important parts of the gene in terms of function. We can test their individual contributions to the activity of the gene product by creating in the laboratory mutations of specific sites within the gene, or by constructing artificial hybrid genes that combine part of one gene with part of another. Organisms can be engineered to make either the RNA or the protein specified by the gene in large quantities to facilitate biochemical analysis. Specialists in molecular structure can determine the three-dimensional conformation of the gene product, revealing the exact position of every atom in it. Biochemists can determine how each of the parts of the genetically specified molecule contributes to its chemical behavior. Cell biologists can analyze the behavior of cells that are engineered to express a mutant version of the gene.</voice></speak>"
ch1, part 23,"There is, however, no one simple recipe for discovering a gene’s function, and no simple standard universal format for describing it. We may discover, for example, that the product of a given gene catalyzes a certain chemical reaction, and yet have no idea how or why that reaction is important to the organism. The functional characterization of each new family of gene products, unlike the description of the gene sequences, presents a fresh challenge to the biologist’s ingenuity. Moreover, we will never fully understand the function of a gene until we learn its role in the life of the organism as a whole. To make ultimate sense of gene functions, therefore, we have to study whole organisms, not just molecules or cells.
Molecular Biology Began with a Spotlight on E coli
Because living organisms are so complex, the more we learn about any particular species, the more attractive it becomes as an object for further study. Each discovery raises new questions and provides new tools with which to tackle general questions in the context of the chosen organism. For this reason, large communities of biologists have become dedicated to studying different aspects of the same model organism.
In the early days of molecular biology, the spotlight focused intensely on just one species: the Escherichia coli, or E coli, bacterium (see Figures 1–13 and 1–14). This small, rod-shaped bacterial cell normally lives in the gut of humans and other vertebrates, but it can be grown easily in a simple nutrient broth in a culture bottle. It adapts to variable chemical conditions and reproduces rapidly, and it can evolve by mutation and selection at a remarkable speed. As with other bacteria, different strains of E coli, though classified as members of a single species, differ genetically to a much greater degree than do different varieties of a sexually reproducing organism such as a plant or animal. One E coli strain may possess many hundreds of genes that are absent from another, and the two strains could have as little as 50% of their genes in common. The standard laboratory strain E coli K-12 has a genome of approximately 4.6 million nucleotide pairs, contained in a single circular molecule of DNA that codes for about 4300 different kinds of proteins (Figure 1–24).
In molecular terms, we know more about E coli than about any other living organism. Most of our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of life—for example, how cells replicate their DNA, or how they decode the instructions represented in the DNA to direct the synthesis of specific proteins—initially came from studies of E coli. The basic genetic mechanisms have turned out to be highly conserved throughout evolution: these mechanisms are essentially the same in our own cells as in E coli.","<!--ID=B7267351-473F-409D-9765-754A8EBCDE05;Version=1|{""VoiceNameToIdMapItems"":[{""Name"":""Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, ChristopherNeural)"",""ShortName"":""en-US-ChristopherNeural"",""Locale"":""en-US"",""Id"":""4337134d-4e59-48d1-af56-f4e96771bda1"",""VoiceType"":""StandardVoice""}]}-->

ch1, part 24,"Summary
Prokaryotes (cells without a distinct nucleus) are biochemically the most diverse organisms and include species that can obtain all their energy and nutrients from inorganic chemical sources, such as the reactive mixtures of minerals released at hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor—the sort of diet that may have nourished the first living cells 3.5 billion years ago. DNA sequence comparisons reveal the family relationships of living organisms and show that the prokaryotes fall into two groups that diverged early in the course of evolution: the bacteria (or eubacteria) and the archaea. Together with the eukaryotes (cells with a membrane-enclosed nucleus), these constitute the three primary branches of the tree of life.
Most bacteria and archaea are small unicellular organisms with compact genomes comprising 1000–6000 genes. Many of the genes within a single organism show strong family resemblances in their DNA sequences, implying that they originated from the same ancestral gene through gene duplication and divergence. Family resemblances (homologies) are also clear when gene sequences are compared between different species, and more than 200 gene families have been so highly conserved that they can be recognized as common to most species from all three domains of the living world. Thus, given the DNA sequence of a newly discovered gene, it is often possible to deduce the gene’s function from the known function of a homologous gene in an intensively studied model organism, such as the bacterium E coli.
Genetic Information in Eukaryotes
Eukaryotic cells, in general, are bigger and more elaborate than prokaryotic cells, and their genomes are bigger and more elaborate, too. The greater size is accompanied by radical differences in cell structure and function. Moreover, many classes of eukaryotic cells form multicellular organisms that attain levels of complexity unmatched by any prokaryote.
Because they are so complex, eukaryotes confront molecular biologists with a special set of challenges that will concern us in the rest of this book. Increasingly, biologists attempt to meet these challenges through the analysis and manipulation of the genetic information within cells and organisms. It is therefore important at the outset to know something of the special features of the eukaryotic genome. We begin by briefly discussing how eukaryotic cells are organized, how this reflects their way of life, and how their genomes differ from those of prokaryotes. This leads us to an outline of the strategy by which cell biologists, by exploiting genetic and biochemical information, are attempting to discover how eukaryotic organisms work.","<!--ID=B7267351-473F-409D-9765-754A8EBCDE05;Version=1|{""VoiceNameToIdMapItems"":[{""Name"":""Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, ChristopherNeural)"",""ShortName"":""en-US-ChristopherNeural"",""Locale"":""en-US"",""Id"":""4337134d-4e59-48d1-af56-f4e96771bda1"",""VoiceType"":""StandardVoice""}]}-->

ch1, part 25,"Eukaryotic Cells May Have Originated as Predators
By definition, eukaryotic cells keep their DNA in an internal compartment called the nucleus. The nuclear envelope, a double layer of membrane, surrounds the nucleus and separates the DNA from the cytoplasm. Eukaryotes also have other features that set them apart from prokaryotes (Figure 1–25). Their cells are, typically, 10 times bigger in linear dimension and 1000 times larger in volume. They have an elaborate cytoskeleton—a system of protein filaments crisscrossing the cytoplasm and forming, together with the many proteins that attach to them, a system of girders, ropes, and motors that gives the cell mechanical strength, controls its shape, and drives and guides its movements (Movie 1.1). And the nuclear envelope is only one part of a set of internal membranes, each structurally similar to the plasma membrane and enclosing different types of spaces inside the cell, many of them involved in digestion and secretion. Lacking the tough cell wall of most bacteria, animal cells and the free-living eukaryotic cells called protozoa can change their shape rapidly and engulf other cells and small objects by phagocytosis (Figure 1–26).
How all of the unique properties of eukaryotic cells evolved, and in what sequence, is still a mystery. One plausible view, however, is that they are all reflections of the way of life of a primordial cell that was a predator, living by capturing other cells and eating them (Figure 1–27). Such a way of life requires a large cell with a flexible plasma membrane, as well as an elaborate cytoskeleton to support and move this membrane. It may also require that the cell’s long, fragile DNA molecules be sequestered in a separate nuclear compartment, to protect the genome from damage by the movements of the cytoskeleton.","<!--ID=B7267351-473F-409D-9765-754A8EBCDE05;Version=1|{""VoiceNameToIdMapItems"":[{""Name"":""Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, ChristopherNeural)"",""ShortName"":""en-US-ChristopherNeural"",""Locale"":""en-US"",""Id"":""4337134d-4e59-48d1-af56-f4e96771bda1"",""VoiceType"":""StandardVoice""}]}-->

ch1, part 26,"Modern Eukaryotic Cells Evolved from a Symbiosis
A predatory way of life helps to explain another feature of eukaryotic cells. All such cells contain (or at one time did contain) mitochondria (Figure 1–28). These small bodies in the cytoplasm, enclosed by a double layer of membrane, take up oxygen and harness energy from the oxidation of food molecules—such as sugars—to produce most of the ATP that powers the cell’s activities. Mitochondria are similar in size to small bacteria, and, like bacteria, they have their own genome in the form of a circular DNA molecule, their own ribosomes that differ from those elsewhere in the eukaryotic cell, and their own transfer RNAs. It is now generally accepted that mitochondria originated from free-living oxygen-metabolizing (aerobic) bacteria that were engulfed by an ancestral cell that could otherwise make no such use of oxygen (that is, was anaerobic). Escaping digestion, these bacteria evolved in symbiosis with the engulfing cell and its progeny, receiving shelter and nourishment in return for the power generation they performed for their hosts. This partnership between a primitive anaerobic predator cell and an aerobic bacterial cell is thought to have been established about 1.5 billion years ago, when the Earth’s atmosphere first became rich in oxygen.
As indicated in Figure 1–29, recent genomic analyses suggest that the first eukaryotic cells formed after an archaeal cell engulfed an aerobic bacterium. This would explain why all eukaryotic cells today, including those that live as strict anaerobes show clear evidence that they once contained mitochondria.
Many eukaryotic cells—specifically, those of plants and algae—also contain another class of small membrane-enclosed organelles somewhat similar to mitochondria—the chloroplasts (Figure 1–30). Chloroplasts perform photosynthesis, using the energy of sunlight to synthesize carbohydrates from atmospheric carbon dioxide and water, and deliver the products to the host cell as food. Like mitochondria, chloroplasts have their own genome. They almost certainly originated as symbiotic photosynthetic bacteria, acquired by eukaryotic cells that already possessed mitochondria (Figure 1–31).
A eukaryotic cell equipped with chloroplasts has no need to chase after other cells as prey; it is nourished by the captive chloroplasts it has inherited from its ancestors. Correspondingly, plant cells, although they possess the cytoskeletal equipment for movement, have lost the ability to change shape rapidly and to engulf other cells by phagocytosis. Instead, they create around themselves a tough, protective cell wall. If the first eukaryotic cells were predators on other organisms, we can view plant cells as cells that have made the transition from hunting to farming.","<!--ID=B7267351-473F-409D-9765-754A8EBCDE05;Version=1|{""VoiceNameToIdMapItems"":[{""Name"":""Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, ChristopherNeural)"",""ShortName"":""en-US-ChristopherNeural"",""Locale"":""en-US"",""Id"":""4337134d-4e59-48d1-af56-f4e96771bda1"",""VoiceType"":""StandardVoice""}]}-->

ch1, part 27,"Fungi represent yet another eukaryotic way of life. Fungal cells, like animal cells, possess mitochondria but not chloroplasts; but in contrast with animal cells and protozoa, they have a tough outer wall that limits their ability to move rapidly or to swallow up other cells. Fungi, it seems, have turned from hunters into scavengers: other cells secrete nutrient molecules or release them upon death, and fungi feed on these leavings—performing whatever digestion is necessary extracellularly, by secreting digestive enzymes to the exterior.
Eukaryotes Have Hybrid Genomes
The genetic information of eukaryotic cells has a hybrid origin—from the ancestral anaerobic archaeal cell, and from the bacteria that it adopted as symbionts. Most of this information is stored in the nucleus, but a small amount remains inside the mitochondria and, for plant and algal cells, in the chloroplasts. When mitochondrial DNA and the chloroplast DNA are separated from the nuclear DNA and individually analyzed and sequenced, the mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes are found to be degenerate, cut-down versions of the corresponding bacterial genomes. In a human cell, for example, the mitochondrial genome consists of only 16,569 nucleotide pairs, and codes for only 13 proteins, 2 ribosomal RNA components, and 22 transfer RNAs.
Many of the genes that are missing from the mitochondria and chloroplasts have not been lost; instead, they have moved from the symbiont genome into the DNA of the host cell nucleus. The nuclear DNA of humans contains many genes coding for proteins that serve essential functions inside the mitochondria; in plants, the nuclear DNA also contains many genes specifying proteins required in chloroplasts. In both cases, the DNA sequences of these nuclear genes show clear evidence of their origin from the bacterial ancestor of the respective organelle.
Eukaryotic Genomes Are Big
Natural selection has evidently favored mitochondria with small genomes. By contrast, the nuclear genomes of most eukaryotes seem to have been free to enlarge. Perhaps the eukaryotic way of life has made large size an advantage: predators typically need to be bigger than their prey, and cell size generally increases in proportion to genome size. Whatever the reason, aided by a massive accumulation of DNA segments derived from parasitic transposable elements (discussed in Chapter 5), the genomes of most eukaryotes have become orders of magnitude larger than those of bacteria and archaea (Figure 1–32).","<!--ID=B7267351-473F-409D-9765-754A8EBCDE05;Version=1|{""VoiceNameToIdMapItems"":[{""Name"":""Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, ChristopherNeural)"",""ShortName"":""en-US-ChristopherNeural"",""Locale"":""en-US"",""Id"":""4337134d-4e59-48d1-af56-f4e96771bda1"",""VoiceType"":""StandardVoice""}]}-->

ch1, part 28,"The freedom to be extravagant with DNA has had profound implications. Eukaryotes not only have more genes than prokaryotes; they also have vastly more DNA that does not code for protein. The human genome contains 1000 times as many nucleotide pairs as the genome of a typical bacterium, perhaps 10 times as many genes, and a great deal more noncoding DNA (~98.5% of the genome for a human does not code for proteins, as opposed to 11% of the genome for the bacterium E coli). The estimated genome sizes and gene numbers for some eukaryotes are compiled for easy comparison with E coli in Table 1–2; we shall discuss how each of these eukaryotes serves as a model organism shortly.
Eukaryotic Genomes Are Rich in Regulatory DNA
Much of our noncoding DNA is almost certainly dispensable junk, retained like a mass of old papers because, when there is little pressure to keep an archive small, it is easier to retain everything than to sort out the valuable information and discard the rest. Certain exceptional eukaryotic species, such as the puffer fish, bear witness to the profligacy of their relatives; they have somehow managed to rid themselves of large quantities of noncoding DNA. Yet they appear similar in structure, behavior, and fitness to related species that have vastly more such DNA (see Figure 4–71).
Even in compact eukaryotic genomes such as that of puffer fish, there is more noncoding DNA than coding DNA, and at least some of the noncoding DNA certainly has important functions. In particular, it regulates the expression of adjacent genes. With this regulatory DNA, eukaryotes have evolved distinctive ways of controlling when and where a gene is brought into play. This sophisticated gene regulation is crucial for the formation of complex multicellular organisms.
The Genome Defines the Program of Multicellular Development
The cells in an individual animal or plant are extraordinarily varied. Fat cells, skin cells, bone cells, nerve cells—they seem as dissimilar as any cells could be (Figure 1–33). Yet all these cell types are the descendants of a single fertilized egg cell, and all (with minor exceptions) contain identical copies of the genome of the species.
The differences result from the way in which the cells make selective use of their genetic instructions according to the cues they get from their surroundings in the developing embryo. The DNA is not just a shopping list specifying the molecules that every cell must have, and the cell is not an assembly of all the items on the list. Rather, the cell behaves as a multipurpose machine, with sensors to receive environmental signals and with highly developed abilities to call different sets of genes into action according to the sequences of signals to which the cell has been exposed. The genome in each cell is big enough to accommodate the information that specifies an entire multicellular organism, but in any individual cell only part of that information is used.","<!--ID=B7267351-473F-409D-9765-754A8EBCDE05;Version=1|{""VoiceNameToIdMapItems"":[{""Name"":""Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, ChristopherNeural)"",""ShortName"":""en-US-ChristopherNeural"",""Locale"":""en-US"",""Id"":""4337134d-4e59-48d1-af56-f4e96771bda1"",""VoiceType"":""StandardVoice""}]}-->

The human genome contains 1000 times as many nucleotide pairs as the genome of a typical bacterium, perhaps 10 times as many genes, and a great deal more noncoding DNA (~98.5% of the genome for a human does not code for proteins, as opposed to 11% of the genome for the bacterium E coli).

ch1, part 29,"A large number of genes in the eukaryotic genome code for proteins that regulate the activities of other genes. Most of these transcription regulators act by binding, directly or indirectly, to the regulatory DNA adjacent to the genes that are to be controlled, or by interfering with the abilities of other proteins to do so. The expanded genome of eukaryotes therefore not only specifies the hardware of the cell, but also stores the software that controls how that hardware is used (Figure 1–34).
Cells do not just passively receive signals; rather, they actively exchange signals with their neighbors. Thus, in a developing multicellular organism, the same control system governs each cell, but with different consequences depending on the messages exchanged. The outcome, astonishingly, is a precisely patterned array of cells in different states, each displaying a character appropriate to its position in the multicellular structure.
Many Eukaryotes Live as Solitary Cells
Many species of eukaryotic cells lead a solitary life—some as hunters (the protozoa), some as photosynthesizers (the unicellular algae), some as scavengers (the unicellular fungi, or yeasts). Figure 1–35 conveys something of the astonishing variety of the single-celled eukaryotes. The anatomy of protozoa, especially, is often elaborate and includes such structures as sensory bristles, photoreceptors, sinuously beating cilia, leglike appendages, mouth parts, stinging darts, and musclelike contractile bundles. Although they are single cells, protozoa can be as intricate, as versatile, and as complex in their behavior as many multicellular organisms (see Figure 1–27, Movie 1.4, and Movie 1.5).
In terms of their ancestry and DNA sequences, the unicellular eukaryotes are far more diverse than the multicellular animals, plants, and fungi, which arose as three comparatively late branches of the eukaryotic pedigree (see Figure 1–17). As with prokaryotes, humans have tended to neglect them because they are microscopic. Only now, with the help of genome analysis, are we beginning to understand their positions in the tree of life, and to put into context the glimpses these strange creatures can offer us of our distant evolutionary past.
A Yeast Serves as a Minimal Model Eukaryote
The molecular and genetic complexity of eukaryotes is daunting. Even more than for prokaryotes, biologists need to concentrate their limited resources on a few selected model organisms to unravel this complexity. 
To analyze the internal workings of the eukaryotic cell without the additional problems of multicellular development, it makes sense to use a species that is unicellular and as simple as possible.

ch1, part 30,"S cerevisiae is a small, single-celled member of the kingdom of fungi and thus, according to modern views, is at least as closely related to animals as it is to plants. It is robust and easy to grow in a simple nutrient medium. Like other fungi, it has a tough cell wall, is relatively immobile, and possesses mitochondria but not chloroplasts. When nutrients are plentiful, it grows and divides almost as rapidly as a bacterium. It can reproduce either vegetatively (that is, by simple cell division), or sexually: two yeast cells that are haploid (possessing a single copy of the genome) can fuse to create a cell that is diploid (containing a double genome); and the diploid cell can undergo meiosis (a reduction division) to produce cells that are once again haploid (Figure 1–37). In contrast with higher plants and animals, the yeast can divide indefinitely in either the haploid or the diploid state, and the process leading from one state to the other can be induced at will by changing the growth conditions.
In addition to these features, the yeast has a further property that makes it a convenient organism for genetic studies: its genome, by eukaryotic standards, is exceptionally small. Nevertheless, it suffices for all the basic tasks that every eukaryotic cell must perform. Mutants are available for essentially every gene, and studies on yeasts (using both S cerevisiae and other species) have provided a key to many crucial processes, including the eukaryotic cell-division cycle—the critical chain of events by which the nucleus and all the other components of a cell are duplicated and parceled out to create two daughter cells from one. The control system that governs this process has been so well conserved over the course of evolution that many of its components can function interchangeably in yeast and human cells: if a mutant yeast lacking an essential yeast cell-division-cycle gene is supplied with a copy of the homologous cell-division-cycle gene from a human, the yeast is cured of its defect and becomes able to divide normally.
The Expression Levels of All the Genes of An Organism Can Be Monitored Simultaneously
The complete genome sequence of S cerevisiae, determined in 1997, consists of approximately 13,117,000 nucleotide pairs, including the small contribution (78,520 nucleotide pairs) of the mitochondrial DNA. This total is only about 2.5 times as much DNA as there is in E coli, and it codes for only 1.5 times as many distinct proteins (about 6600 in all). The way of life of S cerevisiae is similar in many ways to that of a bacterium, and it seems that this yeast has likewise been subject to selection pressures that have kept its genome compact.","<!--ID=B7267351-473F-409D-9765-754A8EBCDE05;Version=1|{""VoiceNameToIdMapItems"":[{""Name"":""Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, ChristopherNeural)"",""ShortName"":""en-US-ChristopherNeural"",""Locale"":""en-US"",""Id"":""4337134d-4e59-48d1-af56-f4e96771bda1"",""VoiceType"":""StandardVoice""}]}-->

Arabidopsis Has Been Chosen Out of 300,000 Species As a Model Plant
The large multicellular organisms that we see around us—the flowers and trees and animals—seem fantastically varied, but they are much closer to one another in their evolutionary origins, and more similar in their basic cell biology, than the great host of microscopic single-celled organisms. Thus, while bacteria and archaea are separated by perhaps 3.5 billion years of evolution, vertebrates and insects are separated by about 700 million years, fish and mammals by about 450 million years, and the different species of flowering plants by only about 150 million years.
Because of the close evolutionary relationship between all flowering plants, we can, once again, get insight into the cell and molecular biology of this whole class of organisms by focusing on just one or a few species for detailed analysis. Out of the several hundred thousand species of flowering plants on Earth today, molecular biologists have chosen to concentrate their efforts on a small weed, the common Thale cress Arabidopsis thaliana (Figure 1–38), which can be grown indoors in large numbers and produces thousands of offspring per plant after 8–10 weeks. Arabidopsis has a total genome size of approximately 220 million nucleotide pairs, about 17 times the size of yeast’s (see Table 1–2).

ch1, part 32,"Caenorhabditis elegans (Figure 1–39) is a small, harmless relative of the eelworm that attacks crops. With a life cycle of only a few days, an ability to survive in a freezer indefinitely in a state of suspended animation, a simple body plan, and an unusual life cycle that is well suited for genetic studies (described in Chapter 21), it is an ideal model organism. C elegans develops with clockwork precision from a fertilized egg cell into an adult worm with exactly 959 body cells (plus a variable number of egg and sperm cells)—an unusual degree of regularity for an animal. We now have a minutely detailed description of the sequence of events by which this occurs, as the cells divide, move, and change their character according to strict and predictable rules. The genome of 130 million nucleotide pairs codes for about 21,000 proteins, and many mutants and other tools are available for the testing of gene functions. Although the worm has a body plan very different from our own, the conservation of biological mechanisms has been sufficient for the worm to be a model for many of the developmental and cell-biological processes that occur in the human body. Thus, for example, studies of the worm have been critical for helping us to understand the programs of cell division and cell death that determine the number of cells in the body—a topic of great importance for both developmental biology and cancer research.
Studies in Drosophila Provide a Key to Vertebrate Development
The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (Figure 1–40) has been used as a model genetic organism for longer than any other; in fact, the foundations of classical genetics were built to a large extent on studies of this insect.

With a life cycle of only a few days, an ability to survive in a freezer indefinitely in a state of suspended animation, a simple body plan, and an unusual life cycle that is well suited for genetic studies (described in Chapter 21), it is an ideal model organism. C elegans develops with clockwork precision from a fertilized egg cell into an adult worm with exactly 959 body cells (plus a variable number of egg and sperm cells)—an unusual degree of regularity for an animal. We now have a minutely detailed description of the sequence of events by which this occurs, as the cells divide, move, and change their character according to strict and predictable rules. The genome of 130 million nucleotide pairs codes for about 21,000 proteins, and many mutants and other tools are available for the testing of gene functions. Although the worm has a body plan very different from our own, the conservation of biological mechanisms has been sufficient for the worm to be a model for many of the developmental and cell-biological processes that occur in the human body. Thus, for example, studies of the worm have been critical for helping us to understand the programs of cell division and cell death that determine the number of cells in the body—a topic of great importance for both developmental biology and cancer research.</voice>
<voice name=""en-US-ChristopherNeural"">Studies in Drosophila Provide a Key to Vertebrate Development</voice>
<voice name=""en-US-ChristopherNeural"">The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (Figure 1–40) has been used as a model genetic organism for longer than any other; in fact, the foundations of classical genetics were built to a large extent on studies of this insect. Over 80 years ago, it provided, for example, definitive proof that genes—the abstract units of hereditary information—are carried on chromosomes, concrete physical objects whose behavior had been closely followed in the eukaryotic cell with the light microscope, but whose function was at first unknown. The proof depended on one of the many features that make Drosophila peculiarly convenient for genetics—the giant chromosomes, with characteristic banded appearance, that are visible in some of its cells (Figure 1–41). Specific changes in the hereditary information, manifest in families of mutant flies, were found to correlate exactly with the loss or alteration of specific giant-chromosome bands.</voice></speak>"
ch1, part 33,"In more recent times, Drosophila, more than any other organism, has shown us how to trace the chain of cause and effect from the genetic instructions encoded in the chromosomal DNA to the structure of the adult multicellular body. Drosophila mutants with body parts strangely misplaced or mispatterned provided the key to the identification and characterization of the genes required to make a properly structured body, with gut, limbs, eyes, and all the other parts in their correct places. Once these Drosophila genes were sequenced, the genomes of vertebrates could be scanned for homologs. These were found, and their functions in vertebrates were then tested by analyzing mice in which the genes had been mutated. The results, as we see later in the book, reveal an astonishing degree of similarity in the molecular mechanisms that govern insect and vertebrate development (discussed in Chapter 21).
The majority of all named species of living organisms are insects. Even if Drosophila had nothing in common with vertebrates, but only with insects, it would still be an important model organism. But if understanding the molecular genetics of vertebrates is the goal, why not simply tackle the problem head-on? Why sidle up to it obliquely, through studies in Drosophila?
Drosophila requires only 9 days to progress from a fertilized egg to an adult; it is vastly easier and cheaper to breed than any vertebrate, and its genome is much smaller—about 200 million nucleotide pairs, compared with 3200 million for a human. This genome codes for about 15,000 proteins, and mutants can now be obtained for essentially any gene. But there is also another, deeper reason why genetic mechanisms that are hard to discover in a vertebrate are often readily revealed in the fly. This relates, as we now explain, to the frequency of gene duplication, which is substantially greater in vertebrate genomes than in the fly genome and has probably been crucial in making vertebrates the complex and subtle creatures that they are.
The Vertebrate Genome Is a Product of Repeated Duplications
Almost every gene in the vertebrate genome has paralogs—other genes in the same genome that are unmistakably related and must have arisen by gene duplication. In many cases, a whole cluster of genes is closely related to similar clusters present elsewhere in the genome, suggesting that genes have been duplicated in linked groups rather than as isolated individuals. According to one hypothesis, at an early stage in the evolution of the vertebrates, the entire genome underwent duplication twice in succession, giving rise to four copies of every gene.","<!--ID=B7267351-473F-409D-9765-754A8EBCDE05;Version=1|{""VoiceNameToIdMapItems"":[{""Name"":""Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, ChristopherNeural)"",""ShortName"":""en-US-ChristopherNeural"",""Locale"":""en-US"",""Id"":""4337134d-4e59-48d1-af56-f4e96771bda1"",""VoiceType"":""StandardVoice""}]}-->

ch1, part 34,"The precise course of vertebrate genome evolution remains uncertain, because many further evolutionary changes have occurred since these ancient events. 
Genes that were once identical have diverged; many of the gene copies have been lost through disruptive mutations; some have undergone further rounds of local duplication; and the genome, in each branch of the vertebrate family tree, has suffered repeated rearrangements, breaking up most of the original gene orderings. Comparison of the gene order in two related organisms, such as the human and the mouse, reveals that—on the time scale of vertebrate evolution—chromosomes frequently fuse and fragment to move large blocks of DNA sequence around. Indeed, it is possible, as discussed in Chapter 4, that the present state of affairs is the result of many separate duplications of fragments of the genome, rather than duplications of the genome as a whole.
There is, however, no doubt that such whole-genome duplications do occur from time to time in evolution, for we can see recent instances in which duplicated chromosome sets are still clearly identifiable as such. The frog genus Xenopus, for example, comprises a set of closely similar species related to one another by repeated duplications or triplications of the whole genome. Among these frogs are X tropicalis, with an ordinary diploid genome; the common laboratory species X laevis, with a duplicated genome and twice as much DNA per cell; and X ruwenzoriensis, with a sixfold reduplication of the original genome and six times as much DNA per cell (108 chromosomes, compared with 36 in X laevis, for example). These species are estimated to have diverged from one another within the past 120 million years (Figure 1–42).
The Frog and the Zebrafish Provide Accessible Models for Vertebrate Development
Frogs have long been used to study the early steps of embryonic development in vertebrates, because their eggs are big, easy to manipulate, and fertilized outside of the animal, so that the subsequent development of the early embryo is easily followed (Figure 1–43). Xenopus laevis, in particular, continues to be an important model organism, even though it is poorly suited for genetic analysis (Movie 1.6 and see Movie 21.1). 
The zebrafish Danio rerio has similar advantages, but without this drawback. Its genome is compact—only half as big as that of a mouse or a human—and it has a generation time of only about three months. Many mutants are known, and genetic engineering is relatively easy. The zebrafish has the added virtue that it is transparent for the first two weeks of its life, so that one can watch the behavior of individual cells in the living organism (see Movie 21.2). All this has made it an increasingly important model vertebrate (Figure 1–44).","<!--ID=B7267351-473F-409D-9765-754A8EBCDE05;Version=1|{""VoiceNameToIdMapItems"":[{""Name"":""Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, ChristopherNeural)"",""ShortName"":""en-US-ChristopherNeural"",""Locale"":""en-US"",""Id"":""4337134d-4e59-48d1-af56-f4e96771bda1"",""VoiceType"":""StandardVoice""}]}-->

ch1, part 35,"The Mouse Is the Predominant Mammalian Model Organism
Mammals have typically two times as many genes as Drosophila, a genome that is 16 times larger, and millions or billions of times as many cells in their adult bodies. In terms of genome size and function, cell biology, and molecular mechanisms, mammals are nevertheless a highly uniform group of organisms. Even anatomically, the differences among mammals are chiefly a matter of size and proportions; it is hard to think of a human body part that does not have a counterpart in elephants and mice, and vice versa. Evolution plays freely with quantitative features, but it does not readily change the logic of the structure.
For a more exact measure of how closely mammalian species resemble one another genetically, we can compare the nucleotide sequences of corresponding (orthologous) genes, or the amino acid sequences of the proteins that these genes encode. The results for individual genes and proteins vary widely. But typically, if we line up the amino acid sequence of a human protein with that of the orthologous protein from, say, an elephant, about 85% of the amino acids are identical. A similar comparison between human and bird shows an amino acid identity of about 70%—twice as many differences, because the bird and the mammalian lineages have had twice as long to diverge as those of the elephant and the human (Figure 1–45).
The mouse, being small, hardy, and a rapid breeder, has become the foremost model organism for experimental studies of vertebrate molecular genetics. Many naturally occurring mutations are known, often mimicking the effects of corresponding mutations in humans (Figure 1–46). Methods have been developed, moreover, to test the function of any chosen mouse gene, or of any noncoding portion of the mouse genome, by artificially creating mutations in it, as we explain later in the book.
Just one made-to-order mutant mouse can provide a wealth of information for the cell biologist. It reveals the effects of the chosen mutation in a host of different contexts, simultaneously testing the action of the gene in all the different kinds of cells in the body that could in principle be affected.","<!--ID=B7267351-473F-409D-9765-754A8EBCDE05;Version=1|{""VoiceNameToIdMapItems"":[{""Name"":""Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, ChristopherNeural)"",""ShortName"":""en-US-ChristopherNeural"",""Locale"":""en-US"",""Id"":""4337134d-4e59-48d1-af56-f4e96771bda1"",""VoiceType"":""StandardVoice""}]}-->

ch1, part 36,"Humans Report on Their Own Peculiarities
As humans, we have a special interest in the human genome. We want to know the full set of parts from which we are made, and to discover how they work. But even if you were a mouse, preoccupied with the molecular biology of mice, humans would be attractive as model genetic organisms, because of one special property: through medical examinations and self-reporting, we catalog our own genetic (and other) disorders. The human population is enormous, consisting today of some 7 billion individuals, and this self-documenting property means that a huge database of information exists on human mutations. The human genome sequence of more than 3 billion nucleotide pairs has been determined for thousands of different people, making it easier than ever before to identify at a molecular level the precise genetic change responsible for any given human mutant phenotype.
By drawing together the insights from humans, mice, fish, flies, worms, yeasts, plants, and bacteria—using gene sequence similarities to map out the correspondences between one model organism and another—we are enriching our understanding of them all.
We Are All Different in Detail
What precisely do we mean when we speak of the human genome? Whose genome? On average, any two people taken at random differ in about one or two in every 1000 nucleotide pairs in their DNA sequence. The genome of the human species is, properly speaking, a very complex thing, embracing the entire pool of variant genes found in the human population. Knowledge of this variation is helping us to understand, for example, why some people are prone to one disease, others to another; why some respond well to a drug, others badly. It is also providing clues to our history—the population movements and minglings of our ancestors, the infections they suffered, the diets they ate. All these things have left traces in the variant forms of genes that survive today in the human communities that populate the globe.
To Understand Cells and Organisms Will Require Mathematics, Computers, and Quantitative Information
Empowered by knowledge of complete genome sequences, we can list the genes, proteins, and RNA molecules in a cell, and we have methods that allow us to begin to depict the complex web of interactions between them.

We want to know the full set of parts from which we are made, and to discover how they work. But even if you were a mouse, preoccupied with the molecular biology of mice, humans would be attractive as model genetic organisms, because of one special property: through medical examinations and self-reporting, we catalog our own genetic (and other) disorders. The human population is enormous, consisting today of some 7 billion individuals, and this self-documenting property means that a huge database of information exists on human mutations. The human genome sequence of more than 3 billion nucleotide pairs has been determined for thousands of different people, making it easier than ever before to identify at a molecular level the precise genetic change responsible for any given human mutant phenotype.</voice>

Whose genome? On average, any two people taken at random differ in about one or two in every 1000 nucleotide pairs in their DNA sequence. The genome of the human species is, properly speaking, a very complex thing, embracing the entire pool of variant genes found in the human population. Knowledge of this variation is helping us to understand, for example, why some people are prone to one disease, others to another; why some respond well to a drug, others badly. It is also providing clues to our history—the population movements and minglings of our ancestors, the infections they suffered, the diets they ate. All these things have left traces in the variant forms of genes that survive today in the human communities that populate the globe.</voice>

Such tools for quantitative reasoning are essential, but they are not all-powerful.

To progress from qualitative descriptions and intuitive reasoning to quantitative descriptions and mathematical deduction is one of the biggest challenges for contemporary cell biology.

ch1, part 38,"Summary
Eukaryotic cells, by definition, keep their DNA in a separate membrane-enclosed compartment, the nucleus. They have, in addition, a cytoskeleton for support and movement, elaborate intracellular compartments for digestion and secretion, the capacity (in many species) to engulf other cells, and a metabolism that depends on the oxidation of organic molecules by mitochondria. These properties suggest that eukaryotes may have originated as predators on other cells. Mitochondria—and, in plants, chloroplasts—contain their own genetic material, and they evidently evolved from bacteria that were taken up into the cytoplasm of ancient cells and survived as symbionts.
Eukaryotic cells typically have 3–30 times as many genes as prokaryotes, and often thousands of times more noncoding DNA. The noncoding DNA allows for great complexity in the regulation of gene expression, as required for the construction of complex multicellular organisms. Many eukaryotes are, however, unicellular—among them the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which serves as a simple model organism for eukaryotic cell biology, revealing the molecular basis of many fundamental processes that have been strikingly conserved during a billion years of evolution. A small number of other organisms have also been chosen for intensive study: a worm, a fly, a fish, and the mouse serve as “model organisms” for multicellular animals; and a small milkweed serves as a model for plants.
Powerful new technologies such as genome sequencing are producing striking advances in our knowledge of human beings, and they are helping to advance our understanding of human health and disease. But living systems are incredibly complex, and mammalian genomes contain multiple closely related homologs of most genes. This genetic redundancy has allowed diversification and specialization of genes for new purposes, but it also makes biological mechanisms harder to decipher. For this reason, simpler model organisms have played a key part in revealing universal genetic mechanisms of animal development, and research using these systems remains critical for driving scientific and medical advances.","<!--ID=B7267351-473F-409D-9765-754A8EBCDE05;Version=1|{""VoiceNameToIdMapItems"":[{""Name"":""Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, ChristopherNeural)"",""ShortName"":""en-US-ChristopherNeural"",""Locale"":""en-US"",""Id"":""4337134d-4e59-48d1-af56-f4e96771bda1"",""VoiceType"":""StandardVoice""}]}-->
