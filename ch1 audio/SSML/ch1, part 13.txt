They are located where the ocean floor is spreading as new portions of the Earth’s crust form by a gradual upwelling of material from the Earth’s interior (Figure 1–11). Downward-percolating seawater is heated and driven back upward as a submarine geyser, carrying with it a current of chemicals from the hot rocks below. A typical cocktail might include H2S, H2, CO, Mn2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, CH2, NH4+, and phosphorus-containing compounds. A dense population of microbes lives in the neighborhood of the vent, thriving on this austere diet and harvesting free energy from reactions between the available chemicals. Other organisms—clams, mussels, and giant marine worms—in turn <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="lɪˈv">live</phoneme> off the microbes at the vent, forming an entire ecosystem analogous to the world of plants and animals that we belong to, but powered by geochemical energy instead of light (Figure 1–12).</voice>
<voice name="en-US-ChristopherNeural">Some Cells Fix Nitrogen and Carbon Dioxide for Others</voice>
<voice name="en-US-ChristopherNeural">To make a living cell requires matter, as well as free energy. DNA, RNA, and protein are composed of just six elements: hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus. These are all plentiful in the nonliving environment, in the Earth’s rocks, water, and atmosphere. But they are not present in chemical forms that allow easy incorporation into biological molecules. Atmospheric N2 and CO2, in particular, are extremely unreactive. A large amount of free energy is required to drive the reactions that use these inorganic molecules to make the organic compounds needed for further biosynthesis—that is, to fix nitrogen and carbon dioxide, so as to make N and C available to living organisms. Many types of living cells lack the biochemical machinery to achieve this fixation; they instead rely on other classes of cells to do the job for them. We animals depend on plants for our supplies of organic carbon and nitrogen compounds. Plants in turn, although they can fix carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, lack the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen; they depend in part on nitrogen-fixing bacteria to supply their need for nitrogen compounds. Plants of the pea family, for example, harbor symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria in nodules in their roots.</voice>
<voice name="en-US-ChristopherNeural">Living cells therefore differ widely in some of the most basic aspects of their biochemistry. Not surprisingly, cells with complementary needs and capabilities have developed close associations. Some of these associations, as we see below, have evolved to the point where the partners have lost their separate identities altogether: they have joined forces to form a single composite cell.</voice></speak>
