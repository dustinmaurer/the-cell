Fungal cells, like animal cells, possess mitochondria but not chloroplasts; but in contrast with animal cells and protozoa, they have a tough outer wall that limits their ability to move rapidly or to swallow up other cells. Fungi, it seems, have turned from hunters into scavengers: other cells secrete nutrient molecules or release them upon death, and fungi feed on these leavings—performing whatever digestion is necessary extracellularly, by secreting digestive enzymes to the exterior.</voice>
<voice name="en-US-ChristopherNeural">Eukaryotes Have Hybrid Genomes</voice>
<voice name="en-US-ChristopherNeural">The genetic information of eukaryotic cells has a hybrid origin—from the ancestral anaerobic archaeal cell, and from the bacteria that it adopted as symbionts. Most of this information is stored in the nucleus, but a small amount remains inside the mitochondria and, for plant and algal cells, in the chloroplasts. When mitochondrial DNA and the chloroplast DNA are separated from the nuclear DNA and individually analyzed and sequenced, the mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes are found to be <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="dɪ.dʒɛˈ.nə.ɹɪˌt">degenerate</phoneme>, cut-down versions of the corresponding bacterial genomes. In a human cell, for example, the mitochondrial genome consists of only 16,569 nucleotide pairs, and codes for only 13 proteins, 2 ribosomal RNA components, and 22 transfer RNAs.</voice>
<voice name="en-US-ChristopherNeural">Many of the genes that are missing from the mitochondria and chloroplasts have not been lost; instead, they have moved from the symbiont genome into the DNA of the host cell nucleus. The nuclear DNA of humans contains many genes coding for proteins that serve essential functions inside the mitochondria; in plants, the nuclear DNA also contains many genes specifying proteins required in chloroplasts. In both cases, the DNA sequences of these nuclear genes show clear evidence of their origin from the bacterial ancestor of the respective organelle.</voice>
<voice name="en-US-ChristopherNeural">Eukaryotic Genomes Are Big</voice>
<voice name="en-US-ChristopherNeural">Natural selection has evidently favored mitochondria with small genomes. By contrast, the nuclear genomes of most eukaryotes seem to have been free to enlarge. Perhaps the eukaryotic way of life has made large size an advantage: predators typically need to be bigger than their prey, and cell size generally increases in proportion to genome size. Whatever the reason, aided by a massive accumulation of DNA segments derived from parasitic transposable elements (discussed in Chapter 5), the genomes of most eukaryotes have become orders of magnitude larger than those of bacteria and archaea (Figure 1–32).</voice></speak>
