<voice name="en-US-ChristopherNeural">By definition, eukaryotic cells keep their DNA in an internal compartment called the nucleus. The nuclear envelope, a double layer of membrane, surrounds the nucleus and separates the DNA from the cytoplasm. Eukaryotes also have other features that set them apart from prokaryotes (Figure 1–25). Their cells are, typically, 10 times bigger in linear dimension and 1000 times larger in volume. They have an elaborate cytoskeleton—a system of protein filaments crisscrossing the cytoplasm and forming, together with the many proteins that attach to them, a system of girders, ropes, and motors that gives the cell mechanical strength, controls its shape, and drives and guides its movements (Movie 1.1). And the nuclear envelope is only one part of a set of internal membranes, each structurally similar to the plasma membrane and enclosing different types of spaces inside the cell, many of them involved in digestion and secretion. Lacking the tough cell wall of most bacteria, animal cells and the free-living eukaryotic cells called protozoa can change their shape rapidly and engulf other cells and small objects by phagocytosis (Figure 1–26).</voice>
<voice name="en-US-ChristopherNeural">How all of the unique properties of eukaryotic cells evolved, and in what sequence, is still a mystery. One plausible view, however, is that they are all reflections of the way of life of a primordial cell that was a predator, living by capturing other cells and eating them (Figure 1–27). Such a way of life requires a large cell with a flexible plasma membrane, as well as an elaborate cytoskeleton to support and move this membrane. It may also require that the cell’s long, fragile DNA molecules be sequestered in a separate nuclear compartment, to protect the genome from damage by the movements of the cytoskeleton.</voice></speak>
