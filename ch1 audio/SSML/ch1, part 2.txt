<speak version="1.0" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xmlns:mstts="http://www.w3.org/2001/mstts" xmlns:emo="http://www.w3.org/2009/10/emotionml" xml:lang="en-US"><voice name="en-US-ChristopherNeural">It is estimated that there are more than 10 million—perhaps 100 million—living species on Earth today. Each species is different, and each reproduces itself faithfully, yielding progeny that belong to the same species: the parent organism hands down information specifying, in extraordinary detail, the characteristics that the offspring shall have. This phenomenon of heredity is central to the definition of life: it distinguishes life from other processes, such as the growth of a crystal, or the burning of a candle, or the formation of waves on water, in which orderly structures are generated but without the same type of link between the peculiarities of parents and the peculiarities of offspring. Like the candle flame, the living organism must consume free energy to create and maintain its organization. But life employs the free energy to drive a hugely complex system of chemical processes that are specified by hereditary information.</voice>
<voice name="en-US-ChristopherNeural">Most living organisms are single cells. Others, such as ourselves, are vast multicellular cities in which groups of cells perform specialized functions linked by intricate systems of communication. But even for the aggregate of more than 10 to the 13 cells that form a human body, the whole organism has been generated by cell divisions from a single cell. The single cell, therefore, is the vehicle for all of the hereditary information that defines each species (Figure 1–1). This cell includes the machinery to gather raw materials from the environment and to construct from them a new cell in its own image, complete with a new copy of its hereditary information. Each and every cell is truly amazing.</voice>
<voice name="en-US-ChristopherNeural">All Cells Store Their Hereditary Information in the Same Linear Chemical Code: DNA</voice>
<voice name="en-US-ChristopherNeural">Computers have made us familiar with the concept of information as a measurable quantity—a million bytes (to record a few hundred pages of text or an image from a digital camera), 600 million bytes for the music on a CD, and so on. Computers have also made us well aware that the same information can be recorded in many different physical forms: the discs and tapes that we used 20 years ago for our electronic archives have become unreadable on present-day machines. Living cells, like computers, store information, and it is estimated that they have been evolving and diversifying for over 3.5 billion years. It is scarcely to be expected that they would all store their information in the same form, or that the archives of one type of cell should be readable by the information-handling machinery of another. And yet it is so. All living cells on Earth store their hereditary information in the form of double-stranded molecules of DNA—long, unbranched, paired polymer chains, formed always of the same four types of monomers. </voice></speak>
