Together these two sets of reactions constitute the metabolism of the cell (Figure 2–14).</voice>

But the general principles by which cells obtain energy from their environment and use it to create order are central to cell biology. We begin with a discussion of why a constant input of energy is needed to sustain all living things.</voice>

This law has such profound implications for life that we will restate it in several ways.</voice>
<voice name="en-US-ChristopherNeural"><lexicon uri="https://cvoiceprodusw.blob.core.windows.net/acc-public-files/b17c5e854155462a8df79933ffd0ab33/21119753-7cf2-4607-a7b3-b4d004813645.xml" />For example, we can present the second law in terms of probability by stating that systems will change spontaneously toward those arrangements that have the greatest probability. If we consider a box of 100 coins all lying heads up, a series of accidents that disturbs the box will tend to move the arrangement toward a mixture of 50 heads and 50 tails. The reason is simple: there is a huge number of possible arrangements of the individual coins in the mixture that can achieve the 50–50 result, but only one possible arrangement that keeps all of the coins oriented heads up. Because the 50–50 mixture is therefore the most probable, we say that it is more “disordered.” For the same reason, it is a common experience that one’s living space will become increasingly disordered without intentional effort: the movement toward disorder is a spontaneous process, requiring a periodic effort to reverse it (Figure 2–15).</voice>

Thus, another way to express the second law of thermodynamics is to say that systems will change spontaneously toward arrangements with greater entropy.</voice></speak>
