<voice name="en-US-ChristopherNeural"><lexicon uri="https://cvoiceprodusw.blob.core.windows.net/acc-public-files/b17c5e854155462a8df79933ffd0ab33/21119753-7cf2-4607-a7b3-b4d004813645.xml" />Much of biology depends on the specific binding of different molecules caused by three types of noncovalent bonds: electrostatic attractions (ionic bonds), hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals attractions; and on a fourth factor that can push molecules together: the hydrophobic force. The properties of the four types of noncovalent attractions are presented in Panel 2 3 (pp. 94–95). Although each individual noncovalent attraction would be much too weak to be effective in the face of thermal motions, their energies can sum to create a strong force between two separate molecules. Thus sets of noncovalent attractions often allow the complementary surfaces of two macromolecules to hold those two macromolecules together (Figure 2–3).</voice>

Note that, by forming competing interactions with the involved molecules, water greatly reduces the strength of both electrostatic attractions and hydrogen bonds.</voice>

This bond represents a special form of polar interaction in which an electropositive hydrogen atom is shared by two electronegative atoms. Its hydrogen can be viewed as a proton that has partially dissociated from a donor atom, allowing it to be shared by a second acceptor atom. Unlike a typical electrostatic interaction, this bond is highly directional—being strongest when a straight line can be drawn between all three of the involved atoms.</voice>

However, a very important hydrophobic force is caused by a pushing of nonpolar surfaces out of the hydrogen-bonded water network, where they would otherwise physically interfere with the highly favorable interactions between water molecules. Bringing any two nonpolar surfaces together reduces their contact with water; in this sense, the force is nonspecific. Nevertheless, we shall see in Chapter 3 that hydrophobic forces are central to the proper folding of protein molecules.</voice></speak>
