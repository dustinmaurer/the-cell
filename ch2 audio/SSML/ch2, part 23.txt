Here, energy from ATP hydrolysis is first used to convert B–OH to a higher-energy intermediate compound, which then reacts directly with A H to give A B. The simplest possible mechanism involves the transfer of a phosphate from ATP to B–OH to make B–O–PO3, in which case the reaction pathway contains only two steps:</voice>

A biosynthetic reaction of exactly this type synthesizes the amino acid glutamine (Figure 2–35B). We will see shortly that similar (but more complex) mechanisms are also used to produce nearly all of the large molecules of the cell.</voice>

<voice name="en-US-ChristopherNeural"><lexicon uri="https://cvoiceprodusw.blob.core.windows.net/acc-public-files/b17c5e854155462a8df79933ffd0ab33/21119753-7cf2-4607-a7b3-b4d004813645.xml" />Other important activated carrier molecules participate in oxidation reduction reactions and are commonly part of coupled reactions in cells. These activated carriers are specialized to carry electrons held at a high energy level (sometimes called “high-energy” electrons) and hydrogen atoms. The most important of these electron carriers are NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and the closely related molecule NADP+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). Each picks up a “packet of energy” corresponding to two electrons plus a proton (H+), and they are thereby converted to NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and NADPH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), respectively (Figure 2–36). These molecules can therefore be regarded as carriers of hydride ions (the H+ plus two electrons, or H minus).</voice>

The NADPH is produced according to the general scheme shown in Figure 2–36A. During a special set of energy-yielding catabolic reactions, two hydrogen atoms are removed from a substrate molecule. Both electrons but just one proton (that is, a hydride ion, H minus) are added to the nicotinamide ring of NADP+ to form NADPH; the second proton (H+) is released into solution. This is a typical oxidation reduction reaction, in which the substrate is oxidized and NADP+ is reduced.</voice></speak>
