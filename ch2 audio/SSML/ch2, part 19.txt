In the late nineteenth century, the relationship was determined through a thermodynamic analysis that makes it possible to separate the concentration-dependent and the concentration-independent parts of the free-energy change, as we describe next.</voice>

To place reactions on a comparable basis, we need to turn to the standard free-energy change of a reaction, delta G°. The delta G° is the change in free energy under a standard condition, defined as that where the concentrations of all the reactants are set to the same fixed value of 1 mole/liter. Defined in this way, delta G° depends only on the intrinsic characters of the reacting molecules.</voice>

At 37°C, RT = 2.58 Jules per mole. (A mole is 6 × 10 to the 23 molecules of a substance.)</voice>

Given these delta G° values, combined with additional information about metabolite concentrations and reaction pathways, it is possible to quantitatively predict the course of most biological reactions.</voice>

<voice name="en-US-ChristopherNeural"><lexicon uri="https://cvoiceprodusw.blob.core.windows.net/acc-public-files/b17c5e854155462a8df79933ffd0ab33/21119753-7cf2-4607-a7b3-b4d004813645.xml" />Inspection of the above equation reveals that the delta G equals the value of delta G° when the concentrations of Y and X are equal. But as any favorable reaction proceeds, the concentrations of the products will increase as the concentration of the substrates decreases. This change in relative concentrations will cause [X]/[Y] to become increasingly large, making the initially favorable delta G less and less negative (the logarithm of a number x is positive for x &gt; 1, negative for x &lt; 1, and zero for x=1). Eventually, when delta G = 0, a chemical equilibrium will be attained; here there is no net change in free energy to drive the reaction in either direction, inasmuch as the concentration effect just balances the push given to the reaction by delta G°. As a result, the ratio of product to substrate reaches a constant value at chemical equilibrium (Figure 2–30).</voice></speak>
