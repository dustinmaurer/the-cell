According to the second law of thermodynamics the universe tends toward maximum disorder (largest entropy or greatest probability). Thus, a chemical reaction can proceed spontaneously only if it results in a net increase in the disorder of the universe (see Figure 2–16). This disorder of the universe can be expressed most conveniently in terms of the free energy of a system, a concept we touched on earlier.</voice>

The value of G is of interest only when a system undergoes a change, denoted delta G (delta G). The change in G is critical because, as explained in Panel 2–7 (pp. 102–103), delta G is a direct measure of the amount of disorder created in the universe when a reaction takes place. Energetically favorable reactions, by definition, are those that decrease free energy; in other words, they have a negative delta G and disorder the universe (Figure 2–28).</voice>

Conversely, energetically unfavorable reactions with a positive delta G—such as the joining of two amino acids to form a peptide bond—by themselves create order in the universe. Therefore, these reactions can take place only if they are coupled to a second reaction with a negative delta G so large that the delta G of the overall process is negative (Figure 2–29).</voice>

<voice name="en-US-ChristopherNeural"><lexicon uri="https://cvoiceprodusw.blob.core.windows.net/acc-public-files/b17c5e854155462a8df79933ffd0ab33/21119753-7cf2-4607-a7b3-b4d004813645.xml" />As we have just described, a reaction Y in equilibrium with X will go in the direction Y produces X when the associated free-energy change, delta G, is negative, just as a tensed spring left to itself will relax and lose its stored energy to its surroundings as heat. For a chemical reaction, however, delta G depends not only on the energy stored in each individual molecule, but also on the concentrations of the molecules in the reaction mixture. Remember that delta G reflects the degree to which a reaction creates a more disordered—in other words, a more probable—state of the universe. Recalling our coin analogy, it is very likely that a coin will flip from a head to a tail orientation if a jiggling box contains 90 heads and 10 tails, but this is a less probable event if the box has 10 heads and 90 tails.</voice>

For a reversible reaction Y produces X, a large excess of Y over X will tend to drive the reaction in the direction Y produces X. Therefore, as the ratio of Y to X increases, the delta G becomes more negative for the transition Y produces X (and more positive for the transition X produces Y).</voice></speak>
