The hydrogen atom in such a molecule has given up its electron almost entirely to the companion atom, and so exists as an almost naked positively charged hydrogen nucleus—in other words, a proton (H+). When the polar molecule becomes surrounded by water molecules, the proton will be attracted to the partial negative charge on the O atom of an adjacent water molecule. This proton can easily dissociate from its original partner and associate instead with the oxygen atom of the water molecule, generating a hydronium ion (H3O+) (Figure 2–5A). The reverse reaction also takes place very readily, so in the aqueous solution protons are constantly flitting to and fro between one molecule and another.</prosody></voice>

The higher the concentration of H3O+, the more acidic the solution. H3O+ is present even in pure water, at a concentration of 10–7 molar, as a result of the movement of protons from one water molecule to another (Figure 2–5B). By convention, the H3O+ concentration is usually referred to as the H+ concentration, even though most protons in an aqueous solution are present as H3O+. To avoid the use of unwieldy numbers, the concentration of H3O+ is expressed using a logarithmic scale called the pH scale. Pure water has a pH of 7.0 and is said to be neutral—that is, neither acidic (pH less than 7) nor basic (pH greater than 7).</prosody></voice>

Strong acids, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl), lose their protons quickly. Acetic acid, on the other hand, is a weak acid because it holds on to its proton more tightly when dissolved in water. Many of the acids important in the cell—such as molecules containing a carboxyl (COOH) group—are weak acids (see Panel 2 2, pp. 92–93).</prosody></voice>

Acids—especially weak acids—will give up their protons more readily if the concentration of H3O+ in solution is low and will tend to receive them back if the concentration in solution is high.</prosody></voice></speak>
