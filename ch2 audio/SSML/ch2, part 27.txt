<voice name="en-US-ChristopherNeural"><lexicon uri="https://cvoiceprodusw.blob.core.windows.net/acc-public-files/b17c5e854155462a8df79933ffd0ab33/21119753-7cf2-4607-a7b3-b4d004813645.xml" />Living cells need to create and maintain order within themselves to survive and grow. This is thermodynamically possible only because of a continual input of energy, part of which must be released from the cells to their environment as heat that disorders the surroundings. The only chemical reactions possible are those that increase the total amount of disorder in the universe. The free-energy change for a reaction, delta G, measures this disorder, and it must be less than zero for a reaction to proceed spontaneously. This ∆G depends both on the intrinsic properties of the reacting molecules and their concentrations, and it can be calculated from these concentrations if either the equilibrium constant (K) for the reaction or its standard free-energy change, delta G°, is known.</voice>

Animals obtain their energy by eating organic molecules and oxidizing them in a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions that are coupled to the formation of ATP—a common currency of energy in all cells.</voice>

In the biosynthesis of macromolecules, ATP is used to form reactive phosphorylated intermediates. Because the energetically unfavorable reaction of biosynthesis now becomes energetically favorable, ATP hydrolysis is said to drive the reaction. Polymeric molecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, and polysaccharides are assembled from small activated precursor molecules by repetitive condensation reactions that are driven in this way. Other reactive molecules, called either activated carriers or coenzymes, transfer other chemical groups in the course of biosynthesis: NADPH transfers hydrogen as a proton plus two electrons (a hydride ion), for example, whereas acetyl CoA transfers an acetyl group.</voice>

Enzymatic digestion breaks down the large polymeric molecules in food into their monomer subunits—proteins into amino acids, polysaccharides into sugars, and fats into fatty acids and glycerol. After digestion, the small organic molecules derived from food enter the cytosol of cells, where their gradual oxidation begins.</voice></speak>
