NADPH readily gives up the hydride ion it carries in a subsequent oxidation–reduction reaction, because the nicotinamide ring can achieve a more stable arrangement of electrons without it. In this subsequent reaction, which regenerates NADP+, it is the NADPH that is oxidized and the substrate that is reduced. The NADPH is an effective donor of its hydride ion to other molecules for the same reason that ATP readily transfers a phosphate: in both cases the transfer is accompanied by a large negative free-energy change. One example of the use of NADPH in biosynthesis is shown in Figure 2–37.
The extra phosphate group on NADPH has no effect on the electron-transfer properties of NADPH compared with NADH, being far away from the region involved in electron transfer (see Figure 2–36C). It does, however, give a molecule of NADPH a slightly different shape from that of NADH, making it possible for NADPH and NADH to bind as substrates to completely different sets of enzymes. Thus, the two types of carriers are used to transfer electrons (or hydride ions) between two different sets of molecules.
Why should there be this division of labor? The answer lies in the need to regulate two sets of electron-transfer reactions independently. NADPH operates chiefly with enzymes that catalyze anabolic reactions, supplying the high-energy electrons needed to synthesize energy-rich biological molecules. NADH, by contrast, has a special role as an intermediate in the catabolic system of reactions that generate ATP through the oxidation of food molecules, as we will discuss shortly. The genesis of NADH from NAD+, and of NADPH from NADP+, occur by different pathways and are independently regulated, so that the cell can adjust the supply of electrons for these two contrasting purposes. Inside the cell the ratio of NAD+ to NADH is kept high, whereas the ratio of NADP+ to NADPH is kept low. This provides plenty of NAD+ to act as an oxidizing agent and plenty of NADPH to act as a reducing agent (Figure 2–37B)—as required for their special roles in catabolism and anabolism, respectively.
There Are Many Other Activated Carrier Molecules in Cells
Other activated carriers also pick up and carry a chemical group in an easily transferred, high-energy linkage. For example, coenzyme A carries a readily transferable acetyl group in a thioester linkage, and in this activated form is known as acetyl CoA (acetyl coenzyme A). Acetyl CoA (Figure 2–38) is used to add two carbon units in the biosynthesis of larger molecules.
