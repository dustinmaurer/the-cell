We can define the equilibrium constant, K, for the reaction Y produces X as
K = [X] over [Y]
where [X] is the concentration of the product and [Y] is the concentration of the reactant at equilibrium. Remembering that delta G = delta G° + RT ln [X] over [Y], and that delta G = 0 at equilibrium, we see that delta G° = –RT ln [X] over [Y] = –RT ln K
At 37°C, where RT = 2.58, the equilibrium equation is therefore:
delta G° = –2.58 ln K
Converting this equation from the natural logarithm (ln) to the more commonly used base 10 logarithm (log), we get
delta G° = –5.94 log K
The above equation reveals how the equilibrium ratio of X to Y (expressed as the equilibrium constant, K) depends on the intrinsic character of the molecules, (as expressed in the value of delta G° in kilojoules per mole). Note that for every 5.94 kJ per mole difference in free energy at 37°C, the equilibrium constant changes by a factor of 10 (Table 2–2). Thus, the more energetically favorable a reaction, the more product will accumulate if the reaction proceeds to equilibrium.
More generally, for a reaction that has multiple reactants and products, such as A + B produces C + D, K = [C] times [D] over [A] times [B]
The concentrations of the two reactants and the two products are multiplied because the rate of the forward reaction depends on the collision of A and B and the rate of the backward reaction depends on the collision of C and D. Thus, at 37°C, delta G° = –5.94 log [C] times [D] over [A] times [B] where delta G° is in kilojoules per mole, and [A], [B], [C], and [D] denote the concentrations of the reactants and products in moles per liter.
The Free-Energy Changes of Coupled Reactions Are Additive
We have pointed out that unfavorable reactions can be coupled to favorable ones to drive the unfavorable ones forward (see Figure 2–29). In thermodynamic terms, this is possible because the overall free-energy change for a set of coupled reactions is the sum of the free-energy changes in each of its component steps. Consider, as a simple example, two sequential reactions X produces Y and Y produces Z whose delta G° values are +5 and –13 kJ per mole, respectively. If these two reactions occur sequentially, the ∆G° for the coupled reaction will be –8 kJ per mole. This means that, with appropriate conditions, the unfavorable reaction X produces Y can be driven by the favorable reaction Y produces Z, provided that this second reaction follows the first. For example, several of the reactions in the long pathway that converts sugars into CO2 and H2O have positive delta G° values. But the pathway nevertheless proceeds because the total delta G° for the series of sequential reactions has a large negative value.
