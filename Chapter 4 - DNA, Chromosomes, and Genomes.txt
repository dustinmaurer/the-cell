How Genomes Evolve

Life depends on the ability of cells to store, retrieve, and translate the genetic instructions required to make and maintain a living organism. This hereditary information is passed on from a cell to its daughter cells at cell division, and from one generation of an organism to the next through the organism’s reproductive cells. The instructions are stored within every living cell as its genes, the information-containing elements that determine the characteristics of a species as a whole and of the individuals within it.

As soon as genetics emerged as a science at the beginning of the twentieth century, scientists became intrigued by the chemical structure of genes. The information in genes is copied and transmitted from cell to daughter cell millions of times during the life of a multicellular organism, and it survives the process essentially unchanged. What form of molecule could be capable of such accurate and almost unlimited replication and also be able to exert precise control, directing multicellular development as well as the daily life of every cell? What kind of instructions does the genetic information contain? And how can the enormous amount of information required for the development and maintenance of an organism fit within the tiny space of a cell?

The answers to several of these questions began to emerge in the 1940s. At this time researchers discovered, from studies in simple fungi, that genetic information consists largely of instructions for making proteins. Proteins are phenomenally versatile macromolecules that perform most cell functions. As we saw in Chapter 3, they serve as building blocks for cell structures and form the enzymes that catalyze most of the cell’s chemical reactions. They also regulate gene expression (Chapter 7), and they enable cells to communicate with each other (Chapter 15) and to move (Chapter 16). The properties and functions of cells and organisms are determined to a great extent by the proteins that they are able to make.

Painstaking observations of cells and embryos in the late nineteenth century had led to the recognition that the hereditary information is carried on chromosomes—threadlike structures in the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell that become visible by light microscopy as the cell begins to divide (Figure 4–1). Later, when biochemical analysis became possible, chromosomes were found to consist of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and protein, with both being present in roughly the same amounts. For many decades, the DNA was thought to be merely a structural element. However, the other crucial advance made in the 1940s was the identification of DNA as the likely carrier of genetic information. This breakthrough in our understanding of cells came from studies of inheritance in bacteria (Figure 4–2). But still, as the 1950s began, both how proteins could be specified by instructions in the DNA and how this information might be copied for transmission from cell to cell seemed completely mysterious. The puzzle was suddenly solved in 1953, when James Watson and Francis Crick derived the mechanism from their model of DNA structure. As outlined in Chapter 1, the determination of the double-helical structure of DNA immediately solved the problem of how the information in this molecule might be copied, or replicated. It also provided the first clues as to how a molecule of DNA might use the sequence of its subunits to encode the instructions for making proteins. Today, the fact that DNA is the genetic material is so fundamental to biological thought that it is difficult to appreciate the enormous intellectual gap that was filled by this breakthrough discovery.

We begin this chapter by describing the structure of DNA. We see how, despite its chemical simplicity, the structure and chemical properties of DNA make it ideally suited as the raw material of genes. We then consider how the many proteins in chromosomes arrange and package this DNA. The packing has to be done in an orderly fashion so that the chromosomes can be replicated and apportioned correctly between the two daughter cells at each cell division. And it must also allow access to chromosomal DNA, both for the enzymes that repair DNA damage and for the specialized proteins that direct the expression of its many genes.

In the past two decades, there has been a revolution in our ability to determine the exact order of subunits in DNA molecules. As a result, we now know the sequence of the 3.2 billion nucleotide pairs that provide the information for producing a human adult from a fertilized egg, as well as having the DNA sequences for thousands of other organisms. Detailed analyses of these sequences are providing exciting insights into the process of evolution, and it is with this subject that the chapter ends. This is the first of four chapters that deal with basic genetic mechanisms—the ways in which the cell maintains, replicates, and expresses the genetic information carried in its DNA. In the next chapter (Chapter 5), we shall discuss the mechanisms by which the cell accurately replicates and repairs DNA; we also describe how DNA sequences can be rearranged through the process of genetic recombination. Gene expression—the process through which the information encoded in DNA is interpreted by the cell to guide the synthesis of proteins—is the main topic of Chapter 6. In Chapter 7, we describe how this gene expression is controlled by the cell to ensure that each of the many thousands of proteins and RNA molecules encrypted in its DNA is manufactured only at the proper time and place in the life of a cell.

THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF DNA

Biologists in the 1940s had difficulty in conceiving how DNA could be the genetic material. The molecule seemed too simple: a long polymer composed of only four types of nucleotide subunits, which resemble one another chemically. Early in the 1950s, DNA was examined by x-ray diffraction analysis, a technique for determining the three-dimensional atomic structure of a molecule (discussed in Chapter 8). The early x-ray diffraction results indicated that DNA was composed of two strands of the polymer wound into a helix. The observation that DNA was double-stranded provided one of the major clues that led to the Watson–Crick model for DNA structure that, as soon as it was proposed in 1953, made DNA’s potential for replication and information storage apparent.

A DNA Molecule Consists of Two Complementary Chains of Nucleotides

###############
 part 3
###############

A deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecule consists of two long polynucleotide chains composed of four types of nucleotide subunits. Each of these chains is known as a DNA chain, or a DNA strand. The chains run antiparallel to each other, and hydrogen bonds between the base portions of the nucleotides hold the two chains together (Figure 4–3). As we saw in Chapter 2 (Panel 2–6, pp. 100–101), nucleotides are composed of a five-carbon sugar to which are attached one or more phosphate groups and a nitrogen-containing base. In the case of the nucleotides in DNA, the sugar is deoxyribose attached to a single phosphate group (hence the name deoxyribonucleic acid), and the base may be either adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), or thymine (T). The nucleotides are covalently linked together in a chain through the sugars and phosphates, which thus form a “backbone” of alternating sugar–phosphate–sugar–phosphate. Because only the base differs in each of the four types of nucleotide subunit, each polynucleotide chain in DNA is analogous to a sugar-phosphate necklace (the backbone), from which hang the four types of beads (the bases A, C, G, and T). These same symbols (A, C, G, and T) are commonly used to denote either the four bases or the four entire nucleotides—that is, the bases with their attached sugar and phosphate groups.

The way in which the nucleotides are linked together gives a DNA strand a chemical polarity. If we think of each sugar as a block with a protruding knob (the 5ʹ phosphate) on one side and a hole (the 3ʹ hydroxyl) on the other (see Figure 4–3), each completed chain, formed by interlocking knobs with holes, will have all of its subunits lined up in the same orientation. Moreover, the two ends of the chain will be easily distinguishable, as one has a hole (the 3ʹ hydroxyl) and the other a knob (the 5ʹ phosphate) at its terminus. This polarity in a DNA chain is indicated by referring to one end as the 3ʹ end and the other as the 5ʹ end, names derived from the orientation of the deoxyribose sugar. With respect to DNA’s information-carrying capacity, the chain of nucleotides in a DNA strand, being both directional and linear, can be read in much the same way as the letters on this page.

###############
 part 4
###############

The three-dimensional structure of DNA—the DNA double helix—arises from the chemical and structural features of its two polynucleotide chains. Because these two chains are held together by hydrogen-bonding between the bases on the different strands, all the bases are on the inside of the double helix, and the sugar-phosphate backbones are on the outside (see Figure 4–3). In each case, a bulkier two-ring base (a purine; see Panel 2–6, pp. 100–101) is paired with a single-ring base (a pyrimidine): A always pairs with T, and G with C (Figure 4–4). This complementary base-pairing enables the base pairs to be packed in the energetically most favorable arrangement in the interior of the double helix. In this arrangement, each base pair is of similar width, thus holding the sugar-phosphate backbones a constant distance apart along the DNA molecule. To maximize the efficiency of base-pair packing, the two sugar-phosphate backbones wind around each other to form a right-handed double helix, with one complete turn every ten base pairs (Figure 4–5).

The members of each base pair can fit together within the double helix only if the two strands of the helix are antiparallel—that is, only if the polarity of one strand is oriented opposite to that of the other strand (see Figures 4–3 and 4–4). A consequence of DNA’s structure and base-pairing requirements is that each strand of a DNA molecule contains a sequence of nucleotides that is exactly complementary to the nucleotide sequence of its partner strand.

The Structure of DNA Provides a Mechanism for Heredity

The discovery of the structure of DNA immediately suggested answers to the two most fundamental questions about heredity. First, how could the information to specify an organism be carried in a chemical form? And second, how could this information be duplicated and copied from generation to generation?

The answer to the first question came from the realization that DNA is a linear polymer of four different kinds of monomer, strung out in a defined sequence like the letters of a document written in an alphabetic script.

The answer to the second question came from the double-stranded nature of the structure: because each strand of DNA contains a sequence of nucleotides that is exactly complementary to the nucleotide sequence of its partner strand, each strand can act as a template, or mold, for the synthesis of a new complementary strand. In other words, if we designate the two DNA strands as S and Sʹ, strand S can serve as a template for making a new strand Sʹ, while strand Sʹ can serve as a template for making a new strand S (Figure 4–6). Thus, the genetic information in DNA can be accurately copied by the beautifully simple process in which strand S separates from strand Sʹ, and each separated strand then serves as a template for the production of a new complementary partner strand that is identical to its former partner.

###############

The ability of each strand of a DNA molecule to act as a template for producing a complementary strand enables a cell to copy, or replicate, its genome before passing it on to its descendants. We shall describe the elegant machinery that the cell uses to perform this task in Chapter 5.

Organisms differ from one another because their respective DNA molecules have different nucleotide sequences and, consequently, carry different biological messages. But how is the nucleotide alphabet used to make messages, and what do they spell out?

As discussed above, it was known well before the structure of DNA was determined that genes contain the instructions for producing proteins. If genes are made of DNA, the DNA must therefore somehow encode proteins (Figure 4–7). As discussed in Chapter 3, the properties of a protein, which are responsible for its biological function, are determined by its three-dimensional structure. This structure is determined in turn by the linear sequence of the amino acids of which it is composed. The linear sequence of nucleotides in a gene must therefore somehow spell out the linear sequence of amino acids in a protein. The exact correspondence between the four-letter nucleotide alphabet of DNA and the twenty-letter amino acid alphabet of proteins—the genetic code—is not at all obvious from the DNA structure, and it took over a decade after the discovery of the double helix before it was worked out. In Chapter 6, we will describe this code in detail in the course of elaborating the process of gene expression, through which a cell converts the nucleotide sequence of a gene first into the nucleotide sequence of an RNA molecule, and then into the amino acid sequence of a protein.

The complete store of information in an organism’s DNA is called its genome, and it specifies all the RNA molecules and proteins that the organism will ever synthesize. (The term genome is also used to describe the DNA that carries this information.) The amount of information contained in genomes is staggering. The nucleotide sequence of a very small human gene, written out in the four-letter nucleotide alphabet, occupies a quarter of a page of text (Figure 4–8), while the complete sequence of nucleotides in the human genome would fill more than a thousand books the size of this one. In addition to other critical information, it includes roughly 21,000 protein-coding genes, which (through alternative splicing; see p. 415) give rise to a much greater number of distinct proteins.

In Eukaryotes, DNA Is Enclosed in a Cell Nucleus

###############
 part 6
###############

As described in Chapter 1, nearly all the DNA in a eukaryotic cell is sequestered in a nucleus, which in many cells occupies about 10% of the total cell volume. This compartment is delimited by a nuclear envelope formed by two concentric lipid bilayer membranes (Figure 4–9). These membranes are punctured at intervals by large nuclear pores, through which molecules move between the nucleus and the cytosol. The nuclear envelope is directly connected to the extensive system of intracellular membranes called the endoplasmic reticulum, which extend out from it into the cytoplasm. And it is mechanically supported by a network of intermediate filaments called the nuclear lamina—a thin feltlike mesh just beneath the inner nuclear membrane (see Figure 4–9B).

The nuclear envelope allows the many proteins that act on DNA to be concentrated where they are needed in the cell, and, as we see in subsequent chapters, it also keeps nuclear and cytosolic enzymes separate, a feature that is crucial for the proper functioning of eukaryotic cells.

Summary

Genetic information is carried in the linear sequence of nucleotides in DNA. Each molecule of DNA is a double helix formed from two complementary antiparallel strands of nucleotides held together by hydrogen bonds between G-C and A-T base pairs. Duplication of the genetic information occurs by the use of one DNA strand as a template for the formation of a complementary strand. The genetic information stored in an organism’s DNA contains the instructions for all the RNA molecules and proteins that the organism will ever synthesize and is said to comprise its genome. In eukaryotes, DNA is contained in the cell nucleus, a large membrane-bound compartment. 

Chromosomal DNA and Its Packaging in the Chromatin Fiber

The most important function of DNA is to carry genes, the information that specifies all the RNA molecules and proteins that make up an organism—including information about when, in what types of cells, and in what quantity each RNA molecule and protein is to be made. The nuclear DNA of eukaryotes is divided up into chromosomes, and in this section we see how genes are typically arranged on each chromosome. In addition, we describe the specialized DNA sequences that are required for a chromosome to be accurately duplicated as a separate entity and passed on from one generation to the next.

###############
 part 7
###############

We also confront the serious challenge of DNA packaging. If the double helices comprising all 46 chromosomes in a human cell could be laid end to end, they would reach approximately 2 meters; yet the nucleus, which contains the DNA, is only about 6μm in diameter. This is geometrically equivalent to packing 40 km (24 miles) of extremely fine thread into a tennis ball. The complex task of packaging DNA is accomplished by specialized proteins that bind to the DNA and fold it, generating a series of organized coils and loops that provide increasingly higher levels of organization, and prevent the DNA from becoming an unmanageable tangle. Amazingly, although the DNA is very tightly compacted, it nevertheless remains accessible to the many enzymes in the cell that replicate it, repair it, and use its genes to produce RNA molecules and proteins.

Eukaryotic DNA Is Packaged into a Set of Chromosomes

Each chromosome in a eukaryotic cell consists of a single, enormously long linear DNA molecule along with the proteins that fold and pack the fine DNA thread into a more compact structure. In addition to the proteins involved in packaging, chromosomes are also associated with many other proteins (as well as numerous RNA molecules). These are required for the processes of gene expression, DNA replication, and DNA repair. The complex of DNA and tightly bound protein is called chromatin (from the Greek chroma, “color,” because of its staining properties).

Bacteria lack a special nuclear compartment, and they generally carry their genes on a single DNA molecule, which is often circular (see Figure 1–24). This DNA is also associated with proteins that package and condense it, but they are different from the proteins that perform these functions in eukaryotes. Although the bacterial DNA with its attendant proteins is often called the bacterial “chromosome,” it does not have the same structure as eukaryotic chromosomes, and less is known about how the bacterial DNA is packaged. Therefore, our discussion of chromosome structure will focus almost entirely on eukaryotic chromosomes.

With the exception of the gametes (eggs and sperm) and a few highly specialized cell types that cannot multiply and either lack DNA altogether (for example, red blood cells) or have replicated their DNA without completing cell division (for example, megakaryocytes), each human cell nucleus contains two copies of each chromosome, one inherited from the mother and one from the father. The maternal and paternal chromosomes of a pair are called homologous chromosomes (homologs). The only nonhomologous chromosome pairs are the sex chromosomes in males, where a Y chromosome is inherited from the father and an X chromosome from the mother. Thus, each human cell contains a total of 46 chromosomes—22 pairs common to both males and females, plus two so-called sex chromosomes (X and Y in males, two Xs in females). These human chromosomes can be readily distinguished by “painting” each one a different color using a technique based on DNA hybridization (Figure 4–10). In this method (described in detail in Chapter 8), a short strand of nucleic acid tagged with a fluorescent dye serves as a “probe” that picks out its complementary DNA sequence, lighting up the target chromosome at any site where it binds. Chromosome painting is most frequently done at the stage in the cell cycle called mitosis, when chromosomes are especially compacted and easy to visualize (see below).

Another more traditional way to distinguish one chromosome from another is to stain them with dyes that reveal a striking and reproducible pattern of bands along each mitotic chromosome (Figure 4–11). These banding patterns presumably reflect variations in chromatin structure, but their basis is not well understood. Nevertheless, the pattern of bands on each type of chromosome is unique, and it provided the initial means to identify and number each human chromosome reliably.

The display of the 46 human chromosomes at mitosis is called the human karyotype. If parts of chromosomes are lost or are switched between chromosomes, these changes can be detected either by changes in the banding patterns or—with greater sensitivity—by changes in the pattern of chromosome painting (Figure 4–12). Cytogeneticists use these alterations to detect inherited chromosome abnormalities and to reveal the chromosome rearrangements that occur in cancer cells as they progress to malignancy (discussed in Chapter 20).

Chromosomes Contain Long Strings of Genes

###############
 part 9
###############

Chromosomes carry genes—the functional units of heredity. A gene is often defined as a segment of DNA that contains the instructions for making a particular protein (or a set of closely related proteins), but this definition is too narrow. Genes that code for protein are indeed the majority, and most of the genes with clear-cut mutant phenotypes fall under this heading. In addition, however, there are many “RNA genes”—segments of DNA that generate a functionally significant RNA molecule, instead of a protein, as their final product. We shall say more about the RNA genes and their products later.

As might be expected, some correlation exists between the complexity of an organism and the number of genes in its genome (see Table 1–2, p. 29). For example, some simple bacteria have only 500 genes, compared to about 30,000 for humans. Bacteria, archaea, and some single-celled eukaryotes, such as yeast, have concise genomes, consisting of little more than strings of closely packed genes. However, the genomes of multicellular plants and animals, as well as many other eukaryotes, contain, in addition to genes, a large quantity of interspersed DNA whose function is poorly understood (Figure 4–13). Some of this additional DNA is crucial for the proper control of gene expression, and this may in part explain why there is so much of it in multicellular organisms, whose genes have to be switched on and off according to complicated rules during development (discussed in Chapters 7 and 21).

Differences in the amount of DNA interspersed between genes, far more than differences in numbers of genes, account for the astonishing variations in genome size that we see when we compare one species with another (see Figure 1–32). For example, the human genome is 200 times larger than that of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but 30 times smaller than that of some plants and amphibians and 200 times smaller than that of a species of amoeba. Moreover, because of differences in the amount of noncoding DNA, the genomes of closely related organisms (bony fish, for example) can vary several hundredfold in their DNA content, even though they contain roughly the same number of genes. Whatever the excess DNA may do, it seems clear that it is not a great handicap for a eukaryotic cell to carry a large amount of it.

###############
 part 10
###############

How the genome is divided into chromosomes also differs from one eukaryotic species to the next. For example, while the cells of humans have 46 chromosomes, those of some small deer have only 6, while those of the common carp contain over 100. Even closely related species with similar genome sizes can have very different numbers and sizes of chromosomes (Figure 4–14). Thus, there is no simple relationship between chromosome number, complexity of the organism, and total genome size. Rather, the genomes and chromosomes of modern-day species have each been shaped by a unique history of seemingly random genetic events, acted on by poorly understood selection pressures over long evolutionary times.

The Nucleotide Sequence of the Human Genome Shows How Our Genes Are Arranged

With the publication of the full DNA sequence of the human genome in 2004, it became possible to see in detail how the genes are arranged along each of our chromosomes (Figure 4–15). It will be many decades before the information contained in the human genome sequence is fully analyzed, but it has already stimulated new experiments that have had major effects on the content of every chapter in this book.

The first striking feature of the human genome is how little of it (only a few percent) codes for proteins (Table 4–1 and Figure 4–16). It is also notable that nearly half of the chromosomal DNA is made up of mobile pieces of DNA that have gradually inserted themselves in the chromosomes over evolutionary time, multiplying like parasites in the genome (see Figure 4–62). We discuss these transposable elements in detail in later chapters.

A second notable feature of the human genome is the large average gene size—about 27,000 nucleotide pairs. As discussed above, a typical gene carries in its linear sequence of nucleotides the information for the linear sequence of the amino acids of a protein. Only about 1300 nucleotide pairs are required to encode a protein of average size (about 430 amino acids in humans). Most of the remaining sequence in a gene consists of long stretches of noncoding DNA that interrupt the relatively short segments of DNA that code for protein. As will be discussed in detail in Chapter 6, the coding sequences are called exons; the intervening (noncoding) sequences in genes are called introns (see Figure 4–15 and Table 4–1). The majority of human genes thus consist of a long string of alternating exons and introns, with most of the gene consisting of introns. In contrast, the majority of genes from organisms with concise genomes lack introns. This accounts for the much smaller size of their genes (about one-twentieth that of human genes), as well as for the much higher fraction of coding DNA in their chromosomes.

###############
 part 11
###############

In addition to introns and exons, each gene is associated with regulatory DNA sequences, which are responsible for ensuring that the gene is turned on or off at the proper time, expressed at the appropriate level, and only in the proper type of cell. In humans, the regulatory sequences for a typical gene are spread out over tens of thousands of nucleotide pairs. As would be expected, these regulatory sequences are much more compressed in organisms with concise genomes. We discuss how regulatory DNA sequences work in Chapter 7.

Research in the last decade has surprised biologists with the discovery that, in addition to 21,000 protein-coding genes, the human genome contains many thousands of genes that encode RNA molecules that do not produce proteins, but instead have a variety of other important functions. What is thus far known about these molecules will be presented in Chapters 6 and 7. Last, but not least, the nucleotide sequence of the human genome has revealed that the archive of information needed to produce a human seems to be in an alarming state of chaos. As one commentator described our genome, “In some ways it may resemble your garage/bedroom/refrigerator/life: highly individualistic, but unkempt; little evidence of organization; much accumulated clutter (referred to by the uninitiated as ‘junk’); virtually nothing ever discarded; and the few patently valuable items indiscriminately, apparently carelessly, scattered throughout.” We shall discuss how this is thought to have come about in the final sections of this chapter entitled “How Genomes Evolve.”

Each DNA Molecule That Forms a Linear Chromosome Must Contain a Centromere, Two Telomeres, and Replication Origins

###############
 part 12
###############

To form a functional chromosome, a DNA molecule must be able to do more than simply carry genes: it must be able to replicate, and the replicated copies must be separated and reliably partitioned into daughter cells at each cell division. This process occurs through an ordered series of stages, collectively known as the cell cycle, which provides for a temporal separation between the duplication of chromosomes and their segregation into two daughter cells. The cell cycle is briefly summarized in Figure 4–17, and it is discussed in detail in Chapter 17. Briefly, during a long interphase, genes are expressed and chromosomes are replicated, with the two replicas remaining together as a pair of sister chromatids. Throughout this time, the chromosomes are extended and much of their chromatin exists as long threads in the nucleus so that individual chromosomes cannot be easily distinguished. It is only during a much briefer period of mitosis that each chromosome condenses so that its two sister chromatids can be separated and distributed to the two daughter nuclei. The highly condensed chromosomes in a dividing cell are known as mitotic chromosomes (Figure 4–18). This is the form in which chromosomes are most easily visualized; in fact, the images of chromosomes shown so far in the chapter are of chromosomes in mitosis.

Each chromosome operates as a distinct structural unit: for a copy to be passed on to each daughter cell at division, each chromosome must be able to replicate, and the newly replicated copies must subsequently be separated and partitioned correctly into the two daughter cells. These basic functions are controlled by three types of specialized nucleotide sequences in the DNA, each of which binds specific proteins that guide the machinery that replicates and segregates chromosomes (Figure 4–19).

Experiments in yeasts, whose chromosomes are relatively small and easy to manipulate, have identified the minimal DNA sequence elements responsible for each of these functions. One type of nucleotide sequence acts as a DNA replication origin, the location at which duplication of the DNA begins. Eukaryotic chromosomes contain many origins of replication to ensure that the entire chromosome can be replicated rapidly, as discussed in detail in Chapter 5.

After DNA replication, the two sister chromatids that form each chromosome remain attached to one another and, as the cell cycle proceeds, are condensed further to produce mitotic chromosomes. The presence of a second specialized DNA sequence, called a centromere, allows one copy of each duplicated and condensed chromosome to be pulled into each daughter cell when a cell divides. A protein complex called a kinetochore forms at the centromere and attaches the duplicated chromosomes to the mitotic spindle, allowing them to be pulled apart (discussed in Chapter 17).

###############
 part 13
###############

The third specialized DNA sequence forms telomeres, the ends of a chromosome. Telomeres contain repeated nucleotide sequences that enable the ends of chromosomes to be efficiently replicated. Telomeres also perform another function: the repeated telomere DNA sequences, together with the regions adjoining them, form structures that protect the end of the chromosome from being mistaken by the cell for a broken DNA molecule in need of repair. We discuss both this type of repair and the structure and function of telomeres in Chapter 5.

In yeast cells, the three types of sequences required to propagate a chromosome are relatively short (typically less than 1000 base pairs each) and therefore use only a tiny fraction of the information-carrying capacity of a chromosome. Although telomere sequences are fairly simple and short in all eukaryotes, the DNA sequences that form centromeres and replication origins in more complex organisms are much longer than their yeast counterparts. For example, experiments suggest that a human centromere can contain up to a million nucleotide pairs and that it may not require a stretch of DNA with a defined nucleotide sequence. Instead, as we shall discuss later in this chapter, a human centromere is thought to consist of a large, regularly repeating protein–nucleic acid structure that can be inherited when a chromosome replicates.

DNA Molecules Are Highly Condensed in Chromosomes

All eukaryotic organisms have special ways of packaging DNA into chromosomes. For example, if the 48 million nucleotide pairs of DNA in human chromosome 22 could be laid out as one long perfect double helix, the molecule would extend for about 1.5 cm if stretched out end to end. But chromosome 22 measures only about 2 μm in length in mitosis (see Figures 4–10 and 4–11), representing an endto-end compaction ratio of over 7000-fold. This remarkable feat of compression is performed by proteins that successively coil and fold the DNA into higher and higher levels of organization. Although much less condensed than mitotic chromosomes, the DNA of human interphase chromosomes is still tightly packed.

In reading these sections it is important to keep in mind that chromosome structure is dynamic. We have seen that each chromosome condenses to an extreme degree in the M phase of the cell cycle. Much less visible, but of enormous interest and importance, specific regions of interphase chromosomes decondense to allow access to specific DNA sequences for gene expression, DNA repair, and replication—and then recondense when these processes are completed. The packaging of chromosomes is therefore accomplished in a way that allows rapid localized, on-demand access to the DNA. In the next sections, we discuss the specialized proteins that make this type of packaging possible.

Nucleosomes Are a Basic Unit of Eukaryotic Chromosome Structure

###############
 part 14
###############

The proteins that bind to the DNA to form eukaryotic chromosomes are traditionally divided into two classes: the histones and the non-histone chromosomal proteins, each contributing about the same mass to a chromosome as the DNA. The complex of both classes of protein with the nuclear DNA of eukaryotic cells is known as chromatin (Figure 4–20).

Histones are responsible for the first and most basic level of chromosome packing, the nucleosome, a protein–DNA complex discovered in 1974. When interphase nuclei are broken open very gently and their contents examined under the electron microscope, most of the chromatin appears to be in the form of a fiber with a diameter of about 30 nm (Figure 4–21A). If this chromatin is subjected to treatments that cause it to unfold partially, it can be seen under the electron microscope as a series of “beads on a string” (Figure 4–21B). The string is DNA, and each bead is a “nucleosome core particle” that consists of DNA wound around a histone core (Movie 4.2).

The structural organization of nucleosomes was determined after first isolating them from unfolded chromatin by digestion with particular enzymes (called nucleases) that break down DNA by cutting between the nucleosomes. After digestion for a short period, the exposed DNA between the nucleosome core particles, the linker DNA, is degraded. Each individual nucleosome core particle consists of a complex of eight histone proteins—two molecules each of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4—and double-stranded DNA that is 147 nucleotide pairs long. The histone octamer forms a protein core around which the double-stranded DNA is wound (Figure 4–22).

The region of linker DNA that separates each nucleosome core particle from the next can vary in length from a few nucleotide pairs up to about 80. (The term nucleosome technically refers to a nucleosome core particle plus one of its adjacent DNA linkers, but it is often used synonymously with nucleosome core particle.) On average, therefore, nucleosomes repeat at intervals of about 200 nucleotide pairs. For example, a diploid human cell with 6.4 × 109 nucleotide pairs contains approximately 30 million nucleosomes. The formation of nucleosomes converts a DNA molecule into a chromatin thread about one-third of its initial length.

The Structure of the Nucleosome Core Particle Reveals How DNA Is Packaged

###############
 part 15
###############

The high-resolution structure of a nucleosome core particle, solved in 1997, revealed a disc-shaped histone core around which the DNA was tightly wrapped in a left-handed coil of 1.7 turns (Figure 4–23). All four of the histones that make up the core of the nucleosome are relatively small proteins (102–135 amino acids), and they share a structural motif, known as the histone fold, formed from three α helices connected by two loops (Figure 4–24). In assembling a nucleosome, the histone folds first bind to each other to form H3–H4 and H2A–H2B dimers, and the H3–H4 dimers combine to form tetramers. An H3–H4 tetramer then further combines with two H2A–H2B dimers to form the compact octamer core, around which the DNA is wound.

The interface between DNA and histone is extensive: 142 hydrogen bonds are formed between DNA and the histone core in each nucleosome. Nearly half of these bonds form between the amino acid backbone of the histones and the sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA. Numerous hydrophobic interactions and salt linkages also hold DNA and protein together in the nucleosome. More than onefifth of the amino acids in each of the core histones are either lysine or arginine (two amino acids with basic side chains), and their positive charges can effectively neutralize the negatively charged DNA backbone. These numerous interactions explain in part why DNA of virtually any sequence can be bound on a histone octamer core. The path of the DNA around the histone core is not smooth; rather, several kinks are seen in the DNA, as expected from the nonuniform surface of the core. The bending requires a substantial compression of the minor groove of the DNA helix. Certain dinucleotides in the minor groove are especially easy to compress, and some nucleotide sequences bind the nucleosome more tightly than others (Figure 4–25). This probably explains some striking, but unusual, cases of very precise positioning of nucleosomes along a stretch of DNA. However, the sequence preference of nucleosomes must be weak enough to allow other factors to dominate, inasmuch as nucleosomes can occupy any one of a number of positions relative to the DNA sequence in most chromosomal regions.

In addition to its histone fold, each of the core histones has an N-terminal amino acid “tail,” which extends out from the DNA–histone core (see Figure 4–24D). These histone tails are subject to several different types of covalent modifications that in turn control critical aspects of chromatin structure and function, as we shall discuss shortly.

As a reflection of their fundamental role in DNA function through controlling chromatin structure, the histones are among the most highly conserved eukaryotic proteins. For example, the amino acid sequence of histone H4 from a pea differs from that of a cow at only 2 of the 102 positions. This strong evolutionary conservation suggests that the functions of histones involve nearly all of their amino acids, so that a change in any position is deleterious to the cell. But in addition to this remarkable conservation, eukaryotic organisms also produce smaller amounts of specialized variant core histones that differ in amino acid sequence from the main ones. As discussed later, these variants, combined with the surprisingly large number of covalent modifications that can be added to the histones in nucleosomes, give rise to a variety of chromatin structures in cells.

Nucleosomes Have a Dynamic Structure, and Are Frequently Subjected to Changes Catalyzed by ATP-Dependent Chromatin Remodeling Complexes

For many years biologists thought that, once formed in a particular position on DNA, a nucleosome would remain fixed in place because of the very tight association between its core histones and DNA. If true, this would pose problems for genetic readout mechanisms, which in principle require easy access to many specific DNA sequences. It would also hinder the rapid passage of the DNA transcription and replication machinery through chromatin. But kinetic experiments show that the DNA in an isolated nucleosome unwraps from each end at a rate of about four times per second, remaining exposed for 10 to 50 milliseconds before the partially unwrapped structure recloses. Thus, most of the DNA in an isolated nucleosome is in principle available for binding other proteins.

###############

###############

For the chromatin in a cell, a further loosening of DNA–histone contacts is clearly required, because eukaryotic cells contain a large variety of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes. These complexes include a subunit that hydrolyzes ATP (an ATPase evolutionarily related to the DNA helicases discussed in Chapter 5). This subunit binds both to the protein core of the nucleosome and to the double-stranded DNA that winds around it. By using the energy of ATP hydrolysis to move this DNA relative to the core, the protein complex changes the structure of a nucleosome temporarily, making the DNA less tightly bound to the histone core. Through repeated cycles of ATP hydrolysis that pull the nucleosome core along the DNA double helix, the remodeling complexes can catalyze nucleosome sliding. In this way, they can reposition nucleosomes to expose specific regions of DNA, thereby making them available to other proteins in the cell (Figure 4–26). In addition, by cooperating with a variety of other proteins that bind to histones and serve as histone chaperones, some remodeling complexes are able to remove either all or part of the nucleosome core from a nucleosome—catalyzing either an exchange of its H2A–H2B histones, or the complete removal of the octameric core from the DNA (Figure 4–27). As a result of such processes, measurements reveal that a typical nucleosome is replaced on the DNA every one or two hours inside the cell.

Cells contain dozens of different ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes that are specialized for different roles. Most are large protein complexes that can contain 10 or more subunits, some of which bind to specific modifications on histones (see Figure 4–26C). The activity of these complexes is carefully controlled by the cell. As genes are turned on and off, chromatin remodeling complexes are brought to specific regions of DNA where they act locally to influence chromatin structure (discussed in Chapter 7; see also Figure 4–40, below).

Although some DNA sequences bind more tightly than others to the nucleosome core (see Figure 4–25), the most important influence on nucleosome positioning appears to be the presence of other tightly bound proteins on the DNA. Some bound proteins favor the formation of a nucleosome adjacent to them. Others create obstacles that force the nucleosomes to move elsewhere. The exact positions of nucleosomes along a stretch of DNA therefore depend mainly on the presence and nature of other proteins bound to the DNA. And due to the presence of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, the arrangement of nucleosomes on DNA can be highly dynamic, changing rapidly according to the needs of the cell.

Nucleosomes Are Usually Packed Together into a Compact Chromatin Fiber

###############
 part 18
###############

Although enormously long strings of nucleosomes form on the chromosomal DNA, chromatin in a living cell probably rarely adopts the extended “beads-on-astring” form. Instead, the nucleosomes are packed on top of one another, generating arrays in which the DNA is even more highly condensed. Thus, when nuclei are very gently lysed onto an electron microscope grid, much of the chromatin is seen to be in the form of a fiber with a diameter of about 30 nm, which is considerably wider than chromatin in the “beads-on-a-string” form (see Figure 4–21).

How nucleosomes are organized into condensed arrays is unclear. The structure of a tetranucleosome (a complex of four nucleosomes) obtained by x-ray crystallography and high-resolution electron microscopy of reconstituted chromatin have been used to support a zigzag model for the stacking of nucleosomes in a 30-nm fiber (Figure 4–28). But cryoelectron microscopy of carefully prepared nuclei suggests that most regions of chromatin are less regularly structured.

What causes nucleosomes to stack so tightly on each other? Nucleosome-tonucleosome linkages that involve histone tails, most notably the H4 tail, constitute one important factor (Figure 4–29). Another important factor is an additional histone that is often present in a 1-to-1 ratio with nucleosome cores, known as histone H1. This so-called linker histone is larger than the individual core histones and it has been considerably less well conserved during evolution. A single histone H1 molecule binds to each nucleosome, contacting both DNA and protein, and changing the path of the DNA as it exits from the nucleosome. This change in the exit path of DNA is thought to help compact nucleosomal DNA (Figure 4–30). Most eukaryotic organisms make several histone H1 proteins of related but quite distinct amino acid sequences. The presence of many other DNA-binding proteins, as well as proteins that bind directly to histones, is certain to add important additional features to any array of nucleosomes.

Summary

###############
 part 19
###############

A gene is a nucleotide sequence in a DNA molecule that acts as a functional unit for the production of a protein, a structural RNA, or a catalytic or regulatory RNA molecule. In eukaryotes, protein-coding genes are usually composed of a string of alternating introns and exons associated with regulatory regions of DNA. A chromosome is formed from a single, enormously long DNA molecule that contains a linear array of many genes, bound to a large set of proteins. The human genome contains 3.2 × 109 DNA nucleotide pairs, divided between 22 different autosomes (present in two copies each) and 2 sex chromosomes. Only a small percentage of this DNA codes for proteins or functional RNA molecules. A chromosomal DNA molecule also contains three other types of important nucleotide sequences: replication origins and telomeres allow the DNA molecule to be efficiently replicated, while a centromere attaches the sister DNA molecules to the mitotic spindle, ensuring their accurate segregation to daughter cells during the M phase of the cell cycle.

The DNA in eukaryotes is tightly bound to an equal mass of histones, which form repeated arrays of DNA–protein particles called nucleosomes. The nucleosome is composed of an octameric core of histone proteins around which the DNA double helix is wrapped. Nucleosomes are spaced at intervals of about 200 nucleotide pairs, and they are usually packed together (with the aid of histone H1 molecules) into quasi-regular arrays to form a 30-nm chromatin fiber. Even though compact, the structure of chromatin must be highly dynamic to allow access to the DNA. There is some spontaneous DNA unwrapping and rewrapping in the nucleosome itself; however, the general strategy for reversibly changing local chromatin structure features ATP-driven chromatin remodeling complexes. Cells contain a large set of such complexes, which are targeted to specific regions of chromatin at appropriate times. The remodeling complexes collaborate with histone chaperones to allow nucleosome cores to be repositioned, reconstituted with different histones, or completely removed to expose the underlying DNA.

CHROMATIN STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION

Having described how DNA is packaged into nucleosomes to create a chromatin fiber, we now turn to the mechanisms that create different chromatin structures in different regions of a cell’s genome. Mechanisms of this type have a variety of important functions in cells. Most strikingly, certain types of chromatin structure can be inherited; that is, the structure can be directly passed down from a cell to its descendants. Because the cell memory that results is based on an inherited chromatin structure rather than on a change in DNA sequence, this is a form of epigenetic inheritance. The prefix epi is Greek for “on”; this is appropriate, because epigenetics represents a form of inheritance that is superimposed on the genetic inheritance based on DNA.

###############
 part 20
###############

In Chapter 7, we shall introduce the many different ways in which the expression of genes is regulated. There we discuss epigenetic inheritance in detail and present several different mechanisms that can produce it. Here, we are concerned with only one, that based on chromatin structure. We begin this section by reviewing the observations that first demonstrated that chromatin structures can be inherited. We then describe some of the chemistry that makes this possible—the covalent modification of histones in nucleosomes. These modifications have many functions, inasmuch as they serve as recognition sites for protein domains that link specific protein complexes to different regions of chromatin. Histones thereby have effects on gene expression, as well as on many other DNA-linked processes. Through such mechanisms, chromatin structure plays an important role in the development, growth, and maintenance of all eukaryotic organisms, including ourselves.

Heterochromatin Is Highly Organized and Restricts Gene Expression

Light-microscope studies in the 1930s distinguished two types of chromatin in the interphase nuclei of many higher eukaryotic cells: a highly condensed form, called heterochromatin, and all the rest, which is less condensed, called euchromatin. Heterochromatin represents an especially compact form of chromatin (see Figure 4–9), and we are finally beginning to understand its molecular properties. It is highly concentrated in certain specialized regions, most notably at the centromeres and telomeres introduced previously (see Figure 4–19), but it is also present at many other locations along chromosomes—locations that can vary according to the physiological state of the cell. In a typical mammalian cell, more than 10% of the genome is packaged in this way.

The DNA in heterochromatin typically contains few genes, and when euchromatic regions are converted to a heterochromatic state, their genes are generally switched off as a result. However, we know now that the term heterochromatin encompasses several distinct modes of chromatin compaction that have different implications for gene expression. Thus, heterochromatin should not be thought of as simply encapsulating “dead” DNA, but rather as a descriptor for compact chromatin domains that share the common feature of being unusually resistant to gene expression.

The Heterochromatic State Is Self-Propagating

###############
 part 21
###############

Through chromosome breakage and rejoining, whether brought about by a natural genetic accident or by experimental artifice, a piece of chromosome that is normally euchromatic can be translocated into the neighborhood of heterochromatin. Remarkably, this often causes silencing—inactivation—of the normally active genes. This phenomenon is referred to as a position effect. It reflects a spreading of the heterochromatic state into the originally euchromatic region, and it has provided important clues to the mechanisms that create and maintain heterochromatin. First recognized in Drosophila, position effects have now been observed in many eukaryotes, including yeasts, plants, and humans.

In chromosome breakage-and-rejoining events of the sort just described, the zone of silencing, where euchromatin is converted to a heterochromatic state, spreads for different distances in different early cells in the fly embryo. Remarkably, these differences then are perpetuated for the rest of the animal’s life: in each cell, once the heterochromatic condition is established on a piece of chromatin, it tends to be stably inherited by all of that cell’s progeny (Figure 4–31). This remarkable phenomenon, called position effect variegation, was first recognized through a detailed genetic analysis of the mottled loss of red pigment in the fly eye (Figure 4–32). It shares features with the extensive spread of heterochromatin that inactivates one of the two X chromosomes in female mammals. There too, a random process acts in each cell of the early embryo to dictate which X chromosome will be inactivated, and that same X chromosome then remains inactive in all the cell’s progeny, creating a mosaic of different clones of cells in the adult body (see Figure 7–50).

These observations, taken together, point to a fundamental strategy of heterochromatin formation: heterochromatin begets more heterochromatin. This positive feedback can operate both in space, causing the heterochromatic state to spread along the chromosome, and in time, across cell generations, propagating the heterochromatic state of the parent cell to its daughters. The challenge is to explain the molecular mechanisms that underlie this remarkable behavior.

###############
 part 22
###############

As a first step, one can carry out a search for the molecules that are involved. This has been done by means of genetic screens, in which large numbers of mutants are generated, after which one picks out those that show an abnormality of the process in question. Extensive genetic screens in Drosophila, fungi, and mice have identified more than 100 genes whose products either enhance or suppress the spread of heterochromatin and its stable inheritance—in other words, genes that serve as either enhancers or suppressors of position effect variegation. Many of these genes turn out to code for non-histone chromosomal proteins that interact with histones and are involved in modifying or maintaining chromatin structure. We shall discuss how they work in the sections that follow.

The Core Histones Are Covalently Modified at Many Different Sites

The amino acid side chains of the four histones in the nucleosome core are subjected to a remarkable variety of covalent modifications, including the acetylation of lysines, the mono-, di-, and trimethylation of lysines, and the phosphorylation of serines (Figure 4–33). A large number of these side-chain modifications occur on the eight relatively unstructured N-terminal “histone tails” that protrude from the nucleosome (Figure 4–34). However, there are also more than 20 specific sidechain modifications on the nucleosome’s globular core.

All of the above types of modifications are reversible, with one enzyme serving to create a particular type of modification, and another to remove it. These enzymes are highly specific. Thus, for example, acetyl groups are added to specific lysines by a set of different histone acetyl transferases (HATs) and removed by a set of histone deacetylase complexes (HDACs). Likewise, methyl groups are added to lysine side chains by a set of different histone methyl transferases and removed by a set of histone demethylases. Each enzyme is recruited to specific sites on the chromatin at defined times in each cell’s life history. For the most part, the initial recruitment depends on transcription regulator proteins (sometimes called “transcription factors”). As we shall explain in Chapter 7, these proteins recognize and bind to specific DNA sequences in the chromosomes. They are produced at different times and places in the life of an organism, thereby determining where and when the chromatin-modifying enzymes will act. In this way, the DNA sequence ultimately determines how histones are modified. But in at least some cases, the covalent modifications on nucleosomes can persist long after the transcription regulator proteins that first induced them have disappeared, thereby providing the cell with a memory of its developmental history. Most remarkably, as in the related phenomenon of position effect variegation discussed above, this memory can be transmitted from one cell generation to the next.

###############
 part 23
###############

Very different patterns of covalent modification are found on different groups of nucleosomes, depending both on their exact position in the genome and on the history of the cell. The modifications of the histones are carefully controlled, and they have important consequences. The acetylation of lysines on the N-terminal tails loosens chromatin structure, in part because adding an acetyl group to lysine removes its positive charge, thereby reducing the affinity of the tails for adjacent nucleosomes. However, the most profound effects of the histone modifications lie in their ability to recruit specific other proteins to the modified stretch of chromatin. Trimethylation of one specific lysine on the histone H3 tail, for instance, attracts the heterochromatin-specific protein HP1 and contributes to the establishment and spread of heterochromatin. More generally, the recruited proteins act with the modified histones to determine how and when genes will be expressed, as well as other chromosome functions. In this way, the precise structure of each domain of chromatin governs the readout of the genetic information that it contains, and thereby the structure and function of the eukaryotic cell. 

Chromatin Acquires Additional Variety Through the Site-Specific Insertion of a Small Set of Histone Variants

In addition to the four highly conserved standard core histones, eukaryotes also contain a few variant histones that can also assemble into nucleosomes. These histones are present in much smaller amounts than the major histones, and they have been less well conserved over long evolutionary times. Variants are known for each of the core histones with the exception of H4; some examples are shown in Figure 4–35.

The major histones are synthesized primarily during the S phase of the cell cycle and assembled into nucleosomes on the daughter DNA helices just behind the replication fork (see Figure 5–32). In contrast, most histone variants are synthesized throughout interphase. They are often inserted into already-formed chromatin, which requires a histone-exchange process catalyzed by the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes discussed previously. These remodeling complexes contain subunits that cause them to bind both to specific sites on chromatin and to histone chaperones that carry a particular variant. As a result, each histone variant is inserted into chromatin in a highly selective manner (see Figure 4–27).

Covalent Modifications and Histone Variants Act in Concert to Control Chromosome Functions

###############
 part 24
###############

The number of possible distinct markings on an individual nucleosome is in principle enormous, and this potential for diversity is still greater when we allow for nucleosomes that contain histone variants. However, the histone modifications are known to occur in coordinated sets. More than 15 such sets can be identified in mammalian cells. However, it is not yet clear how many different types of chromatin are functionally important in cells.

Some combinations are known to have a specific meaning for the cell in the sense that they determine how and when the DNA packaged in the nucleosomes is to be accessed or manipulated—a fact that led to the idea of a “histone code.” For example, one type of marking signals that a stretch of chromatin has been newly replicated, another signals that the DNA in that chromatin has been damaged and needs repair, while others signal when and how gene expression should take place. Various regulatory proteins contain small domains that bind to specific marks, recognizing, for example, a trimethylated lysine 4 on histone H3 (Figure 4–36). These domains are often linked together as modules in a single large protein or protein complex, which thereby recognizes a specific combination of histone modifications (Figure 4–37). The result is a reader complex that allows particular combinations of markings on chromatin to attract additional proteins, so as to execute an appropriate biological function at the right time (Figure 4–38).

The marks on nucleosomes due to covalent additions to histones are dynamic, being constantly removed and added at rates that depend on their chromosomal locations. Because the histone tails extend outward from the nucleosome core and are likely to be accessible even when chromatin is condensed, they would seem to provide an especially suitable format for creating marks that can be readily altered as a cell’s needs change. Although much remains to be learned about the meaning of the different histone modifications, a few well-studied examples of the information that can be encoded in the histone H3 tail are listed in Figure 4–39.

A Complex of Reader and Writer Proteins Can Spread Specific Chromatin Modifications Along a Chromosome

The phenomenon of position effect variegation described previously requires that some modified forms of chromatin have the ability to spread for substantial distances along a chromosomal DNA molecule (see Figure 4–31). How is this possible?

###############
 part 25
###############

The enzymes that add or remove modifications to histones in nucleosomes are part of multisubunit complexes. They can initially be brought to a particular region of chromatin by one of the sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins (transcription regulators) discussed in Chapters 6 and 7 (for a specific example, see Figure 7–20). But after a modifying enzyme “writes” its mark on one or a few neighboring nucleosomes, events that resemble a chain reaction can ensue. In such a case, the “writer enzyme” works in concert with a “reader protein” located in the same protein complex. The reader protein contains a module that recognizes the mark and binds tightly to the newly modified nucleosome (see Figure 4–36), activating an attached writer enzyme and positioning it near an adjacent nucleosome. Through many such read–write cycles, the reader protein can carry the writer enzyme along the DNA—spreading the mark in a hand-over-hand manner along the chromosome (Figure 4–40).

In reality, the process is more complicated than the scheme just described. Both readers and writers are part of a protein complex that is likely to contain multiple readers and writers, and to require multiple marks on the nucleosome to spread. Moreover, many of these reader–writer complexes also contain an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling protein (see Figure 4–26C), and the reader, writer, and remodeling proteins can work in concert to either decondense or condense long stretches of chromatin as the reader moves progressively along the nucleosome-packaged DNA.

A similar process is used to remove histone modifications from specific regions of the DNA; in this case, an “eraser enzyme,” such as a histone demethylase or histone deacetylase, is recruited to the complex. As for the writer complex in Figure 4–40, sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins (transcription regulators) direct where such modifications occur (discussed in Chapter 7).

Some idea of the complexity of the above processes can be derived from the results of genetic screens for genes that either enhance or suppress the spreading and stability of heterochromatin, as manifest in effects on position effect variegation in Drosophila (see Figure 4–32). As pointed out previously, more than 100 such genes are known, and most of them are likely to code for subunits in one or more reader–writer–remodeling protein complexes.

Barrier DNA Sequences Block the Spread of Reader–Writer Complexes and thereby Separate Neighboring Chromatin Domains

###############
 part 26
###############

The above mechanism for spreading chromatin structures raises a potential problem. Inasmuch as each chromosome contains one continuous, very long DNA molecule, what prevents a cacophony of confusing cross-talk between adjacent chromatin domains of different structure and function? Early studies of position effect variegation had suggested an answer: certain DNA sequences mark the boundaries of chromatin domains and separate one such domain from another (see Figure 4–31). Several such barrier sequences have now been identified and characterized through the use of genetic engineering techniques that allow specific DNA segments to be deleted from, or inserted in, chromosomes.

For example, in cells that are destined to give rise to red blood cells, a sequence called HS4 normally separates the active chromatin domain that contains the human β-globin locus from an adjacent region of silenced, condensed chromatin. If this sequence is deleted, the β-globin locus is invaded by condensed chromatin. This chromatin silences the genes it covers, and it spreads to a different extent in different cells, causing position effect variegation similar to that observed in Drosophila. As described in Chapter 7, the consequences are dire: the globin genes are poorly expressed, and individuals who carry such a deletion have a severe form of anemia.

In genetic engineering experiments, the HS4 sequence is often added to both ends of a gene that is to be inserted into a mammalian genome, in order to protect that gene from the silencing caused by spreading heterochromatin. Analysis of this barrier sequence reveals that it contains a cluster of binding sites for histone acetylase enzymes. Since the acetylation of a lysine side chain is incompatible with the methylation of the same side chain, and specific lysine methylations are required to spread heterochromatin, histone acetylases are logical candidates for the formation of DNA barriers to spreading (Figure 4–41). However, several other types of chromatin modifications are known that can also protect genes from silencing.

The Chromatin in Centromeres Reveals How Histone Variants Can Create Special Structures

###############
 part 27
###############

Nucleosomes carrying histone variants have a distinctive character and are thought to be able to produce marks in chromatin that are unusually long-lasting. An important example is seen in the formation and inheritance of the specialized chromatin structure at the centromere, the region of each chromosome required for attachment to the mitotic spindle and orderly segregation of the duplicated copies of the genome into daughter cells each time a cell divides. In many complex organisms, including humans, each centromere is embedded in a stretch of special centromeric chromatin that persists throughout interphase, even though the centromere-mediated attachment to the spindle and movement of DNA occur only during mitosis. This chromatin contains a centromere-specific variant H3 histone, known as CENP-A (Centromere Protein-A; see Figure 4–35), plus additional proteins that pack the nucleosomes into particularly dense arrangements and form the kinetochore, the special structure required for attachment of the mitotic spindle (see Figure 4–19).

A specific DNA sequence of approximately 125 nucleotide pairs is sufficient to serve as a centromere in the yeast S. cerevisiae. Despite its small size, more than a dozen different proteins assemble on this DNA sequence; the proteins include the CENP-A histone H3 variant, which, along with the three other core histones, forms a centromere-specific nucleosome. The additional proteins at the yeast centromere attach this nucleosome to a single microtubule from the yeast mitotic spindle (Figure 4–42).

The centromeres in more complex organisms are considerably larger than those in budding yeasts. For example, fly and human centromeres extend over hundreds of thousands of nucleotide pairs and, while they contain CENP-A, they do not seem to contain a centromere-specific DNA sequence. These centromeres largely consist of short, repeated DNA sequences, known as alpha satellite DNA in humans. But the same repeat sequences are also found at other (non-centromeric) positions on chromosomes, indicating that they are not sufficient to direct centromere formation. Most strikingly, in some unusual cases, new human centromeres (called neocentromeres) have been observed to form spontaneously on fragmented chromosomes. Some of these new positions were originally euchromatic and lack alpha satellite DNA altogether (Figure 4–43). It seems that centromeres in complex organisms are defined by an assembly of proteins, rather than by a specific DNA sequence.

###############
 part 28
###############

Inactivation of some centromeres and genesis of others de novo seem to have played an essential part in evolution. Different species, even when quite closely related, often have different numbers of chromosomes; see Figure 4–14 for an extreme example. As we shall discuss below, detailed genome comparisons show that in many cases the changes in chromosome numbers have arisen through chromosome breakage-and-rejoining events, creating novel chromosomes, some of which must initially have contained abnormal numbers of centromeres—either more than one, or none at all. Yet stable inheritance requires that each chromosome should contain one centromere, and one only. It seems that surplus centromeres must have been inactivated, and/or new centromeres created, so as to allow the rearranged chromosome sets to be stably maintained.

Some Chromatin Structures Can Be Directly Inherited

The changes in centromere activity just discussed, once established, need to be perpetuated through subsequent cell generations. What could be the mechanism of this type of epigenetic inheritance? 

It has been proposed that de novo centromere formation requires an initial seeding event, involving the formation of a specialized DNA–protein structure that contains nucleosomes formed with the CENP-A variant of histone H3. In humans, this seeding event happens more readily on arrays of alpha satellite DNA than on other DNA sequences. The H3–H4 tetramers from each nucleosome on the parental DNA helix are directly inherited by the sister DNA helices at a replication fork (see Figure 5–32). Therefore, once a set of CENP-A-containing nucleosomes has been assembled on a stretch of DNA, it is easy to understand how a new centromere could be generated in the same place on both daughter chromosomes following each round of cell division. One need only assume that the presence of the CENP-A histone in an inherited nucleosome selectively recruits more CENP-A histone to its newly formed neighbors.

There are some striking similarities between the formation and maintenance of centromeres and the formation and maintenance of some other regions of heterochromatin. In particular, the entire centromere forms as an all-or-none entity, suggesting that the creation of centromeric chromatin is a highly cooperative process, spreading out from an initial seed in a manner reminiscent of the phenomenon of position effect variegation that we discussed earlier. In both cases, a particular chromatin structure, once formed, seems to be directly inherited on the DNA following each round of chromosome replication. A cooperative recruitment of proteins, along with the action of reader–writer complexes, can thus not only account for the spreading of specific forms of chromatin in space along the chromosome, but also for its propagation across cell generations—from parent cell to daughter cell (Figure 4–44).

Experiments with Frog Embryos Suggest that both Activating and Repressive Chromatin Structures Can Be Inherited Epigenetically

Epigenetic inheritance plays a central part in the creation of multicellular organisms. Their differentiated cell types become established during development, and persist thereafter even through repeated cell-division cycles. The daughters of a liver cell persist as liver cells, those of an epidermal cell as epidermal cells, and so on, even though they all contain the same genome; and this is because distinctive patterns of gene expression are passed on faithfully from parent cell to daughter cell. Chromatin structure has a role in this epigenetic transmission of information from one cell generation to the next.

One type of evidence comes from studies in which the nucleus of a cell from a frog or tadpole is transplanted into a frog egg whose own nucleus has been removed (an enucleated egg). In a classic set of experiments performed in 1968, it was shown that a nucleus taken from a differentiated donor cell can be reprogrammed in this way to support development of a whole new tadpole (see Figure 7–2). But this reprogramming occurs only with difficulty, and it becomes less and less efficient as nuclei from older animals are used. Thus, for example, less than 2% of the enucleated eggs injected with a nucleus from a tadpole epithelial cell developed to the swimming tadpole stage, compared with 35% when the donor nuclei were taken instead from an early (gastrula-stage) embryo. With new experimental tools, the cause of this resistance to reprogramming can now be traced. It arises, at least in part, because specific chromatin structures in the original differentiated nucleus tend to persist and be transmitted through the many cell-division cycles required for embryonic development. In experiments with Xenopus embryos, specific forms of either repressive or active chromatin structures could be demonstrated to persist through as many as 24 cell divisions, causing the misplaced expression of genes. Figure 4–45 briefly describes one such experiment, focused on chromatin containing the histone variant, H3.3. We shall return to these phenomena in the final section of Chapter 22, where we discuss stem cells and the ways in which one cell type can be converted into another.

Chromatin Structures Are Important for Eukaryotic Chromosome Function

###############
 part 30
###############

Although a great deal remains to be learned about the functions of different chromatin structures, the packaging of DNA into nucleosomes was probably crucial for the evolution of eukaryotes like ourselves. To form a complex multicellular organism, the cells in different lineages must specialize by changing the accessibility and activity of many hundreds of genes. As described in Chapter 21, this process depends on cell memory: each cell holds a record of its past developmental history in the regulatory circuits that control its many genes. That record, it seems, is partly stored in the structure of the chromatin.

Although bacteria also have cell memory mechanisms, the complexity of the memory circuits in higher eukaryotes is unparalleled. Strategies based on local variations in chromatin structure, unique to eukaryotes, can enable individual genes, once they are switched on or switched off, to stay in that state until some new factor acts to reverse it. At one extreme are structures like centromeric chromatin that, once established, are stably inherited from one cell generation to the next. Likewise, the major “classical” type of heterochromatin, which contains long arrays of the HP1 protein (see Figure 4–39), can persist stably throughout life. In contrast, a form of condensed chromatin that is created by the Polycomb group of proteins serves to silence genes that must be kept inactive in some conditions, but are active in others. The latter mechanism governs the expression of a large number of genes that encode transcription regulators important in early embryonic development, as discussed in Chapter 21. There are many other variant forms of chromatin, some with much shorter lifetimes, often less than the division time of the cell. We shall say more about the variety of chromatin types in the next section.

Summary
In the chromosomes of eukaryotes, DNA is uniformly assembled into nucleosomes, but a variety of different chromatin structures is possible. This variety is based on a large set of reversible covalent modifications of the four histones in the nucleosome core. These modifications include the mono-, di-, and trimethylation of many different lysine side chains, an important reaction that is incompatible with the acetylation that can occur on the same lysines. Specific combinations of the modifications mark many nucleosomes, governing their interactions with other proteins. These marks are read when protein modules that are part of a larger protein complex bind to the modified nucleosomes in a region of chromatin. These reader proteins then attract additional proteins that perform various functions.

Some reader protein complexes contain a histone-modifying enzyme, such as a histone lysine methylase, that “writes” the same mark that the reader recognizes. A reader–writer–remodeling complex of this type can spread a specific form of chromatin along a chromosome. In particular, large regions of condensed heterochromatin are thought to be formed in this way. Heterochromatin is commonly found around centromeres and near telomeres, but it is also present at many other positions in chromosomes. The tight packaging of DNA into heterochromatin usually silences the genes within it.

The phenomenon of position effect variegation provides strong evidence for the inheritance of condensed states of chromatin from one cell generation to the next. A similar mechanism appears to be responsible for maintaining the specialized chromatin at centromeres. More generally, the ability to propagate specific chromatin structures across cell generations makes possible an epigenetic cell memory process that plays a role in maintaining the set of different cell states required by complex multicellular organisms.

THE GLOBAL STRUCTURE OF CHROMOSOMES

Having discussed the DNA and protein molecules from which the chromatin fiber is made, we now turn to the organization of the chromosome on a more global scale and the way in which its various domains are arranged in space. As a 30-nm fiber, a typical human chromosome would still be 0.1 cm in length and able to span the nucleus more than 100 times. Clearly, there must be a still higher level of folding, even in interphase chromosomes. Although the molecular details are still largely a mystery, this higher-order packaging almost certainly involves the folding of the chromatin into a series of loops and coils. This chromatin packing is fluid, frequently changing in response to the needs of the cell.

We begin this section by describing some unusual interphase chromosomes that can be easily visualized. Exceptional though they are, these special cases reveal features that are thought to be representative of all interphase chromosomes. Moreover, they provide ways to investigate some fundamental aspects of chromatin structure that we have touched on in the previous section. Next, we describe how a typical interphase chromosome is arranged in the mammalian cell nucleus. Finally, we shall discuss the additional tenfold compaction that chromosomes undergo in the passage from interphase to mitosis.

Chromosomes Are Folded into Large Loops of Chromatin

###############
 part 32
###############

Insight into the structure of the chromosomes in interphase cells has come from studies of the stiff and enormously extended chromosomes in growing amphibian oocytes (immature eggs). These very unusual lampbrush chromosomes (the largest chromosomes known), paired in preparation for meiosis, are clearly visible even in the light microscope, where they are seen to be organized into a series of large chromatin loops emanating from a linear chromosomal axis (Figure 4–46 and Figure 4–47).

In these chromosomes, a given loop always contains the same DNA sequence that remains extended in the same manner as the oocyte grows. These chromosomes are producing large amounts of RNA for the oocyte, and most of the genes present in the DNA loops are being actively expressed. The majority of the DNA, however, is not in loops but remains highly condensed on the chromosome axis, where genes are generally not expressed.

It is thought that the interphase chromosomes of all eukaryotes are similarly arranged in loops. Although these loops are normally too small and fragile to be easily observed in a light microscope, other methods can be used to infer their presence. For example, modern DNA technologies have made it possible to assess the frequency with which any two loci along an interphase chromosome are held together, thus revealing likely candidates for the sites on chromatin that form the bases of loop structures (Figure 4–48). These experiments and others suggest that the DNA in human chromosomes is likely to be organized into loops of various lengths. A typical loop might contain between 50,000 and 200,000 nucleotide pairs of DNA, although loops of a million nucleotide pairs have also been suggested (Figure 4–49).

Polytene Chromosomes Are Uniquely Useful for Visualizing Chromatin Structures

Further insight has come from another unusual class of cells—the polytene cells of flies, such as the fruit fly Drosophila. Some types of cells, in many organisms, grow abnormally large through multiple cycles of DNA synthesis without cell division. Such cells, containing increased numbers of standard chromosomes, are said to be polyploid. In the salivary glands of fly larvae, this process is taken to an extreme degree, creating huge cells that contain hundreds or thousands of copies of the genome. Moreover, in this case, all the copies of each chromosome are aligned side by side in exact register, like drinking straws in a box, to create giant polytene chromosomes. These allow features to be detected that are thought to be shared with ordinary interphase chromosomes, but are normally hard to see.

###############
 part 32
###############

When polytene chromosomes from a fly’s salivary glands are viewed in the light microscope, distinct alternating dark bands and light interbands are visible (Figure 4–50), each formed from a thousand identical DNA sequences arranged side by side in register. About 95% of the DNA in polytene chromosomes is in bands, and 5% is in interbands. A very thin band can contain 3000 nucleotide pairs, while a thick band may contain 200,000 nucleotide pairs in each of its chromatin strands. The chromatin in each band appears dark because the DNA is more condensed than the DNA in interbands; it may also contain a higher concentration of proteins (Figure 4–51). This banding pattern seems to reflect the same sort of organization detected in the amphibian lampbrush chromosomes described earlier.

There are approximately 3700 bands and 3700 interbands in the complete set of Drosophila polytene chromosomes. The bands can be recognized by their different thicknesses and spacings, and each one has been given a number to generate a chromosome “map” that has been indexed to the finished genome sequence of this fly.

The Drosophila polytene chromosomes provide a good starting point for examining how chromatin is organized on a large scale. In the previous section, we saw that there are many forms of chromatin, each of which contains nucleosomes with a different combination of modified histones. Specific sets of non-histone proteins assemble on these nucleosomes to affect biological function in different ways. Recruitment of some of these non-histone proteins can spread for long distances along the DNA, imparting a similar chromatin structure to broad tracts of the genome (see Figure 4–40). Such regions, where all of the chromatin has a similar structure, are separated from neighboring domains by barrier proteins (see Figure 4–41). At low resolution, the interphase chromosome can therefore be considered as a mosaic of chromatin structures, each containing particular nucleosome modifications associated with a particular set of non-histone proteins. Polytene chromosomes allow us to see details of this mosaic of domains in the light microscope, as well as to observe some of the changes associated with gene expression.

There Are Multiple Forms of Chromatin

###############
 part 33
###############

By staining Drosophila polytene chromosomes with antibodies, or by using a more recent technique called ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) analysis (see Chapter 8), the locations of the histone and non-histone proteins in chromatin can be mapped across the entire DNA sequence of an organism’s genome. Such an analysis in Drosophila has thus far localized more than 50 different chromatin proteins and histone modifications. The results suggest that three major types of repressive chromatin predominate in this organism, along with two major types of chromatin on actively transcribed genes, and that each type is associated with a different complex of non-histone proteins. Thus, classical heterochromatin contains more than six such proteins, including heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), whereas the so-called Polycomb form of heterochromatin contains a similar number of proteins of a different set (PcG proteins). In addition to the five major chromatin types, other more minor forms of chromatin appear to be present, each of which may be differently regulated and have distinct roles in the cell.

The set of proteins bound as part of the chromatin at a given locus varies depending on the cell type and its stage of development. These variations make the accessibility of specific genes different in different tissues, helping to generate the cell diversification that accompanies embryonic development (described in Chapter 21).

Chromatin Loops Decondense When the Genes Within Them Are Expressed

When an insect progresses from one developmental stage to another, distinctive chromosome puffs arise and old puffs recede in its polytene chromosomes as new genes become expressed and old ones are turned off (Figure 4–52). From inspection of each puff when it is relatively small and the banding pattern is still discernible, it seems that most puffs arise from the decondensation of a single chromosome band.

The individual chromatin fibers that make up a puff can be visualized with an electron microscope. In favorable cases, loops are seen, much like those observed in amphibian lampbrush chromosomes. When genes in the loop are not expressed, the loop assumes a thickened structure, possibly that of a folded 30-nm fiber, but when gene expression is occurring, the loop becomes more extended. In electron micrographs, the chromatin located on either side of the decondensed loop appears considerably more compact, suggesting that a loop constitutes a distinct functional domain of chromatin structure.

###############
 part 34
###############

Observations in human cells also suggest that highly folded loops of chromatin expand to occupy an increased volume when a gene within them is expressed. For example, quiescent chromosome regions from 0.4 to 2 million nucleotide pairs in length appear as compact dots in an interphase nucleus when visualized by fluorescence microscopy. However, the same DNA is seen to occupy a larger territory when its genes are expressed, with elongated, punctate structures replacing the original dot.

New ways of visualizing individual chromosomes have shown that each of the 46 interphase chromosomes in a human cell tends to occupy its own discrete territory within the nucleus: that is, the chromosomes are not extensively entangled with one another (Figure 4–53). However, pictures such as these present only an average view of the DNA in each chromosome. Experiments that specifically localize the heterochromatic regions of a chromosome reveal that they are often closely associated with the nuclear lamina, regardless of the chromosome examined. And DNA probes that preferentially stain gene-rich regions of human chromosomes produce a striking picture of the interphase nucleus that presumably reflects different average positions for active and inactive genes (Figure 4–54).

How is most of the chromatin in each interphase chromosome condensed when its genes are not being expressed? A powerful extension of the chromosome conformation capture method described previously (see Figure 4–48), which exploits a high-throughput DNA sequencing technology called massive parallel sequencing (see Panel 8–1, pp. 478–481), allows the connections between all of the different one-megabase (1 Mb) segments of the human genome to be mapped in human interphase chromosomes. The results reveal that mostregions of our chromosomes are folded into a conformation referred to as a fractal globule: a knot-free arrangement that facilitates maximally dense packing while, at the same time, preserving the ability of the chromatin fiber to unfold and fold (Figure 4–55).

Chromatin Can Move to Specific Sites Within the Nucleus to Alter Gene Expression

A variety of different types of experiments has led to the conclusion that the position of a gene in the interior of the nucleus changes when it becomes highly expressed. Thus, a region that becomes very actively transcribed is sometimes found to extend out of its chromosome territory, as if in an extended loop (Figure 4–56). We will see in Chapter 6 that the initiation of transcription—the first step in gene expression—requires the assembly of over 100 proteins, and it makes sense that this would be facilitated in regions of the nucleus enriched in these proteins.

###############
 part 35
###############

More generally, it is clear that the nucleus is very heterogeneous, with functionally different regions to which portions of chromosomes can move as they are subjected to different biochemical processes—such as when their gene expression changes. It is this issue that we discuss next.

Networks of Macromolecules Form a Set of Distinct Biochemical Environments inside the Nucleus

In Chapter 6, we shall describe the function of a variety of subcompartments that are present within the nucleus. The largest and most obvious of these is the nucleolus, a structure well known to microscopists even in the nineteenth century (see Figure 4–9). The nucleolus is the cell’s site of ribosome subunit formation, as well as the place where many other specialized reactions occur (see Figure 6–42): it consists of a network of RNAs and proteins concentrated around ribosomal RNA genes that are being actively transcribed. In eukaryotes, the genome contains multiple copies of the ribosomal RNA genes, and although they are typically clustered together in a single nucleolus, they are often located on several separate chromosomes.

A variety of less obvious organelles are also present inside the nucleus. For example, spherical structures called Cajal bodies and interchromatin granule clusters are present in most plant and animal cells (Figure 4–57). Like the nucleolus, these organelles are composed of selected protein and RNA molecules that bind together to create networks that are highly permeable to other protein and RNA molecules in the surrounding nucleoplasm.

Structures such as these can create distinct biochemical environments by immobilizing select groups of macromolecules, as can other networks of proteins and RNA molecules associated with nuclear pores and with the nuclear envelope. In principle, this allows other molecules that enter these spaces to be processed with great efficiency through complex reaction pathways. Highly permeable, fibrous networks of this sort can thereby impart many of the kinetic advantages of compartmentalization (see p. 164) to reactions that take place in subregions of the nucleus (Figure 4–58A). However, unlike the membrane-bound compartments in the cytoplasm (discussed in Chapter 12), these nuclear subcompartments—lacking a lipid bilayer membrane—can neither concentrate nor exclude specific small molecules.

###############
 part 36
###############

The cell has a remarkable ability to construct distinct environments to perform complex biochemical tasks efficiently. Those that we have mentioned in the nucleus facilitate various aspects of gene expression, and will be further discussed in Chapter 6. These subcompartments, including the nucleolus, appear to form only as needed, and they create a high local concentration of the many different enzymes and RNA molecules needed for a particular process. In an analogous way, when DNA is damaged by irradiation, the set of enzymes needed to carry out DNA repair are observed to congregate in discrete foci inside the nucleus, creating “repair factories” (see Figure 5–52). And nuclei often contain hundreds of discrete foci representing factories for DNA or RNA synthesis (see Figure 6–47).

It seems likely that all of these entities make use of the type of tethering illustrated in Figure 4–58B, where long flexible lengths of polypeptide chain and/or long noncoding RNA molecules are interspersed with specific binding sites that concentrate the multiple proteins and other molecules that are needed to catalyze a particular process. Not surprisingly, tethers are similarly used to help to speed biological processes in the cytoplasm, increasing specific reaction rates there (for example, see Figure 16–18).

Is there also an intranuclear framework, analogous to the cytoskeleton, on which chromosomes and other components of the nucleus are organized? The nuclear matrix, or scaffold, has been defined as the insoluble material left in the nucleus after a series of biochemical extraction steps. Many of the proteins and RNA molecules that form this insoluble material are likely to be derived from the fibrous subcompartments of the nucleus just discussed, while others may be proteins that help to form the base of chromosomal loops or to attach chromosomes to other structures in the nucleus.

Mitotic Chromosomes Are Especially Highly Condensed

Having discussed the dynamic structure of interphase chromosomes, we now turn to mitotic chromosomes. The chromosomes from nearly all eukaryotic cells become readily visible by light microscopy during mitosis, when they coil up to form highly condensed structures. This condensation reduces the length of a typical interphase chromosome only about tenfold, but it produces a dramatic change in chromosome appearance.

###############
 part 37
###############

Figure 4–59 depicts a typical mitotic chromosome at the metaphase stage of mitosis (for the stages of mitosis, see Figure 17–3). The two DNA molecules produced by DNA replication during interphase of the cell-division cycle are separately folded to produce two sister chromosomes, or sister chromatids, held together at their centromeres, as mentioned earlier. These chromosomes are normally covered with a variety of molecules, including large amounts of RNA–protein complexes. Once this covering has been stripped away, each chromatid can be seen in electron micrographs to be organized into loops of chromatin emanating from a central scaffolding (Figure 4–60). Experiments using DNA hybridization to detect specific DNA sequences demonstrate that the order of visible features along a mitotic chromosome at least roughly reflects the order of genes along the DNA molecule. Mitotic chromosome condensation can thus be thought of as the final level in the hierarchy of chromosome packaging (Figure 4–61).

The compaction of chromosomes during mitosis is a highly organized and dynamic process that serves at least two important purposes. First, when condensation is complete (in metaphase), sister chromatids have been disentangled from each other and lie side by side. Thus, the sister chromatids can easily separate when the mitotic apparatus begins pulling them apart. Second, the compaction of chromosomes protects the relatively fragile DNA molecules from being broken as they are pulled to separate daughter cells.

The condensation of interphase chromosomes into mitotic chromosomes begins in early M phase, and it is intimately connected with the progression of the cell cycle. During M phase, gene expression shuts down, and specific modifications are made to histones that help to reorganize the chromatin as it compacts. Two classes of ring-shaped proteins, called cohesins and condensins, aid this compaction. How they help to produce the two separately folded chromatids of a mitotic chromosome will be discussed in Chapter 17, along with the details of the cell cycle. 

Summary

Chromosomes are generally decondensed during interphase, so that the details of their structure are difficult to visualize. Notable exceptions are the specialized lampbrush chromosomes of vertebrate oocytes and the polytene chromosomes in the giant secretory cells of insects. Studies of these two types of interphase chromosomes suggest that each long DNA molecule in a chromosome is divided into a large number of discrete domains organized as loops of chromatin that are compacted by further folding. When genes contained in a loop are expressed, the loop unfolds and allows the cell’s machinery access to the DNA.

###############
 part 38
###############

Interphase chromosomes occupy discrete territories in the cell nucleus; that is, they are not extensively intertwined. Euchromatin makes up most of interphase chromosomes and, when not being transcribed, it probably exists as tightly folded fibers of compacted nucleosomes. However, euchromatin is interrupted by stretches of heterochromatin, in which the nucleosomes are subjected to additional packing that usually renders the DNA resistant to gene expression. Heterochromatin exists in several forms, some of which are found in large blocks in and around centromeres and near telomeres. But heterochromatin is also present at many other positions on chromosomes, where it can serve to help regulate developmentally important genes.

The interior of the nucleus is highly dynamic, with heterochromatin often positioned near the nuclear envelope and loops of chromatin moving away from their chromosome territory when genes are very highly expressed. This reflects the existence of nuclear subcompartments, where different sets of biochemical reactions are facilitated by an increased concentration of selected proteins and RNAs. The components involved in forming a subcompartment can self-assemble into discrete organelles such as nucleoli or Cajal bodies; they can also be tethered to fixed structures such as the nuclear envelope.

During mitosis, gene expression shuts down and all chromosomes adopt a highly condensed conformation in a process that begins early in M phase to package the two DNA molecules of each replicated chromosome as two separately folded chromatids. The condensation is accompanied by histone modifications that facilitate chromatin packing, but satisfactory completion of this orderly process, which reduces the end-to-end distance of each DNA molecule from its interphase length by an additional factor of ten, requires additional proteins.

How Genomes Evolve

In this final section of the chapter, we provide an overview of some of the ways that genes and genomes have evolved over time to produce the vast diversity of modern-day life-forms on our planet. The sequencing of the genomes of thousands of organisms is revolutionizing our view of the process of evolution, uncovering an astonishing wealth of information about not only family relationships among organisms, but also about the molecular mechanisms by which evolution has proceeded.

###############
 part 39
###############

It is perhaps not surprising that genes with similar functions can be found in a diverse range of living things. But the great revelation of the past 30 years has been the extent to which the actual nucleotide sequences of many genes have been conserved. Homologous genes—that is, genes that are similar in both their nucleotide sequence and function because of a common ancestry—can often be recognized across vast phylogenetic distances. Unmistakable homologs of many human genes are present in organisms as diverse as nematode worms, fruit flies, yeasts, and even bacteria. In many cases, the resemblance is so close that, for example, the protein-coding portion of a yeast gene can be substituted with its human homolog—even though humans and yeast are separated by more than a billion years of evolutionary history.

As emphasized in Chapter 3, the recognition of sequence similarity has become a major tool for inferring gene and protein function. Although a sequence match does not guarantee similarity in function, it has proved to be an excellent clue. Thus, it is often possible to predict the function of genes in humans for which no biochemical or genetic information is available simply by comparing their nucleotide sequences with the sequences of genes that have been characterized in other more readily studied organisms.

In general, the sequences of individual genes are much more tightly conserved than is overall genome structure. Features of genome organization such as genome size, number of chromosomes, order of genes along chromosomes, abundance and size of introns, and amount of repetitive DNA are found to differ greatly when comparing distant organisms, as does the number of genes that each organism contains. 

Genome Comparisons Reveal Functional DNA Sequences by their Conservation Throughout Evolution

A first obstacle in interpreting the sequence of the 3.2 billion nucleotide pairs in the human genome is the fact that much of it is probably functionally unimportant. The regions of the genome that code for the amino acid sequences of proteins (the exons) are typically found in short segments (average size about 145 nucleotide pairs), small islands in a sea of DNA whose exact nucleotide sequence is thought to be mostly of little consequence. This arrangement makes it difficult to identify all the exons in a stretch of DNA, and it is often hard too to determine exactly where a gene begins and ends.

###############
 part 40
###############

One very important approach to deciphering our genome is to search for DNA sequences that are closely similar between different species, on the principle that DNA sequences that have a function are much more likely to be conserved than those without a function. For example, humans and mice are thought to have diverged from a common mammalian ancestor about 80 × 10 to the 6 years ago, which is long enough for the majority of nucleotides in their genomes to have been changed by random mutational events. Consequently, the only regions that will have remained closely similar in the two genomes are those in which mutations would have impaired function and put the animals carrying them at a disadvantage, resulting in their elimination from the population by natural selection. Such closely similar pieces of DNA sequence are known as conserved regions. In addition to revealing those DNA sequences that encode functionally important exons and RNA molecules, these conserved regions will include regulatory DNA sequences as well as DNA sequences with functions that are not yet known. In contrast, most nonconserved regions will reflect DNA whose sequence is much less likely to be critical for function.

The power of this method can be increased by including in such comparisons the genomes of large numbers of species whose genomes have been sequenced, such as rat, chicken, fish, dog, and chimpanzee, as well as mouse and human. By revealing in this way the results of a very long natural “experiment,” lasting for hundreds of millions of years, such comparative DNA sequencing studies have highlighted the most interesting regions in our genome. The comparisons reveal that roughly 5% of the human genome consists of “multispecies conserved sequences.” To our great surprise, only about one-third of these sequences code for proteins (see Table 4–1, p. 184). Many of the remaining conserved sequences consist of DNA containing clusters of protein-binding sites that are involved in gene regulation, while others produce RNA molecules that are not translated into protein but are important for other known purposes. But, even in the most intensively studied species, the function of the majority of these highly conserved sequences remains unknown. This remarkable discovery has led scientists to conclude that we understand much less about the cell biology of vertebrates than we had thought. Certainly, there are enormous opportunities for new discoveries, and we should expect many more surprises ahead. 

Genome Alterations Are Caused by Failures of the Normal Mechanisms for Copying and Maintaining DNA, as well as by Transposable DNA Elements

###############
 part 41
###############

Evolution depends on accidents and mistakes followed by nonrandom survival. Most of the genetic changes that occur result simply from failures in the normal mechanisms by which genomes are copied or repaired when damaged, although the movement of transposable DNA elements (discussed below) also plays an important part. As we will explain in Chapter 5, the mechanisms that maintain DNA sequences are remarkably precise—but they are not perfect. DNA sequences are inherited with such extraordinary fidelity that typically, along a given line of descent, only about one nucleotide pair in a thousand is randomly changed in the germ line every million years. Even so, in a population of 10,000 diploid individuals, every possible nucleotide substitution will have been “tried out” on about 20 occasions in the course of a million years—a short span of time in relation to the evolution of species.

Errors in DNA replication, DNA recombination, or DNA repair can lead either to simple local changes in DNA sequence—so-called point mutations such as the substitution of one base pair for another—or to large-scale genome rearrangements such as deletions, duplications, inversions, and translocations of DNA from one chromosome to another. In addition to these failures of the genetic machinery, genomes contain mobile DNA elements that are an important source of genomic change (see Table 5–3, p. 267). These transposable DNA elements (transposons) are parasitic DNA sequences that can spread within the genomes they colonize. In the process, they often disrupt the function or alter the regulation of existing genes. On occasion, they have created altogether novel genes through fusions between transposon sequences and segments of existing genes. Over long periods of evolutionary time, DNA transposition events have profoundly affected genomes, so much so that nearly half of the DNA in the human genome consists of recognizable relics of past transposition events (Figure 4–62). Even more of our genome is thought to have been derived from transpositions that occurred so long ago (>108 years) that the sequences can no longer be traced to transposons.

The Genome Sequences of Two Species Differ in Proportion to the Length of Time Since They Have Separately Evolved

The differences between the genomes of species alive today have accumulated over more than 3 billion years. Although we lack a direct record of changes over time, scientists can reconstruct the process of genome evolution from detailed comparisons of the genomes of contemporary organisms.

###############
 part 42
###############

The basic organizing framework for comparative genomics is the phylogenetic tree. A simple example is the tree describing the divergence of humans from the great apes (Figure 4–63). The primary support for this tree comes from comparisons of gene or protein sequences. For example, comparisons between the sequences of human genes or proteins and those of the great apes typically reveal the fewest differences between human and chimpanzee and the most between human and orangutan.

For closely related organisms such as humans and chimpanzees, it is relatively easy to reconstruct the gene sequences of the extinct, last common ancestor of the two species (Figure 4–64). The close similarity between human and chimpanzee genes is mainly due to the short time that has been available for the accumulation of mutations in the two diverging lineages, rather than to functional constraints that have kept the sequences the same. Evidence for this view comes from the observation that the human and chimpanzee genomes are nearly identical even where there is no functional constraint on the nucleotide sequence—such as in the third position of “synonymous” codons (codons specifying the same amino acid but differing in their third nucleotide).

For much less closely related organisms, such as humans and chickens (which have evolved separately for about 300 million years), the sequence conservation found in genes is almost entirely due to purifying selection (that is, selection that eliminates individuals carrying mutations that interfere with important genetic functions), rather than to an inadequate time for mutations to occur.

Phylogenetic Trees Constructed from a Comparison of DNA Sequences Trace the Relationships of All Organisms

Phylogenetic trees based on molecular sequence data can be compared with the fossil record, and we get our best view of evolution by integrating the two approaches. The fossil record remains essential as a source of absolute dates, based on radioisotope decay in the rock formations in which fossils are found. Because the fossil record has many gaps, however, precise divergence times between species are difficult to establish, even for species that leave good fossils with distinctive morphology. 

###############
 part 43
###############

Phylogenetic trees whose timing has been calibrated according to the fossil record suggest that changes in the sequences of particular genes or proteins tend to occur at a nearly constant rate, although rates that differ from the norm by as much as twofold are observed in particular lineages. This provides us with a molecular clock for evolution—or rather a set of molecular clocks corresponding to different categories of DNA sequence. As in the example in Figure 4–65, the clock runs most rapidly and regularly in sequences that are not subject to purifying selection. These include portions of introns that lack splicing or regulatory signals, the third position in synonymous codons, and genes that have been irreversibly inactivated by mutation (the so-called pseudogenes). The clock runs most slowly for sequences that are subject to strong functional constraints—for example, the amino acid sequences of proteins that engage in specific interactions with large numbers of other proteins and whose structure is therefore highly constrained, or the nucleotide sequences that encode the RNA subunits of the ribosome, on which all protein synthesis depends.

Occasionally, rapid change is seen in a previously highly conserved sequence. As discussed later in this chapter, such episodes are especially interesting because they are thought to reflect periods of strong positive selection for mutations that have conferred a selective advantage in the particular lineage where the rapid change occurred.

The pace at which molecular clocks run during evolution is determined not only by the degree of purifying selection, but also by the mutation rate. Most notably, in animals, although not in plants, clocks based on functionally unconstrained mitochondrial DNA sequences run much faster than clocks based on functionally unconstrained nuclear sequences, because the mutation rate in animal mitochondria is exceptionally high.

Categories of DNA for which the clock runs fast are most informative for recent evolutionary events; the mitochondrial DNA clock has been used, for example, to chronicle the divergence of the Neanderthal lineage from that of modern Homo sapiens. To study more ancient evolutionary events, one must examine DNA for which the clock runs more slowly; thus the divergence of the major branches of the tree of life—bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes—has been deduced from study of the sequences specifying ribosomal RNA.

###############
 part 44
###############

In general, molecular clocks, appropriately chosen, have a finer time resolution than the fossil record, and they are a more reliable guide to the detailed structure of phylogenetic trees than are classical methods of tree construction, which are based on family resemblances in anatomy and embryonic development. For example, the precise family tree of great apes and humans was not settled until sufficient molecular sequence data accumulated in the 1980s to produce the pedigree shown previously in Figure 4–63. And with huge amounts of DNA sequence now determined from a wide variety of mammals, much better estimates of our relationship to them are being obtained (Figure 4–66).

A Comparison of Human and Mouse Chromosomes Shows How the Structures of Genomes Diverge

As would be expected, the human and chimpanzee genomes are much more alike than are the human and mouse genomes, even though all three genomes are roughly the same size and contain nearly identical sets of genes. Mouse and human lineages have had approximately 80 million years to diverge through accumulated mutations, versus 6 million years for humans and chimpanzees. In addition, as indicated in Figure 4–66, rodent lineages (represented by the rat and the mouse) have unusually fast molecular clocks, and have diverged from the human lineage more rapidly than otherwise expected.

While the way that the genome is organized into chromosomes is almost identical between humans and chimpanzees, this organization has diverged greatly between humans and mice. According to rough estimates, a total of about 180 breakage-and-rejoining events have occurred in the human and mouse lineages since these two species last shared a common ancestor. In the process, although the number of chromosomes is similar in the two species (23 per haploid genome in the human versus 20 in the mouse), their overall structures differ greatly. Nonetheless, even after the extensive genomic shuffling, there are many large blocks of DNA in which the gene order is the same in the human and the mouse. These stretches of conserved gene order in chromosomes are referred to as regions of synteny. Figure 4–67 illustrates how segments of the different mouse chromosomes map onto the human chromosome set. For much more distantly related vertebrates, such as chicken and human, the number of breakage-and-rejoining events has been much greater and the regions of synteny are much shorter; in addition, they are often hard to discern because of the divergence of the DNA sequences that they contain.

###############
 part 45
###############

An unexpected conclusion from a detailed comparison of the complete mouse and human genome sequences, confirmed by subsequent comparisons between the genomes of other vertebrates, is that small blocks of DNA sequence are being deleted from and added to genomes at a surprisingly rapid rate. Thus, if we assume that our common ancestor had a genome of human size (about 3.2 billion nucleotide pairs), mice would have lost a total of about 45% of that genome from accumulated deletions during the past 80 million years, while humans would have lost about 25%. However, substantial sequence gains from many small chromosome duplications and from the multiplication of transposons have compensated for these deletions. As a result, our genome size is thought to be practically unchanged from that of the last common ancestor of humans and mice, while the mouse genome is smaller by only about 0.3 billion nucleotides.

Good evidence for the loss of DNA sequences in small blocks during evolution can be obtained from a detailed comparison of regions of synteny in the human and mouse genomes. The comparative shrinkage of the mouse genome can be clearly seen from such comparisons, with the net loss of sequences scattered throughout the long stretches of DNA that are otherwise homologous (Figure 4–68).

DNA is added to genomes both by the spontaneous duplication of chromosomal segments that are typically tens of thousands of nucleotide pairs long (as will be discussed shortly) and by insertion of new copies of active transposons. Most transposition events are duplicative, because the original copy of the transposon stays where it was when a copy inserts at the new site; see, for example, Figure 5–63. Comparison of the DNA sequences derived from transposons in the human and the mouse readily reveals some of the sequence additions (Figure 4–69).

It remains a mystery why all mammals have maintained genome sizes of roughly 3 billion nucleotide pairs that contain nearly identical sets of genes, even though only approximately 150 million nucleotide pairs appear to be under sequence-specific functional constraints.

The Size of a Vertebrate Genome Reflects the Relative Rates of DNA Addition and DNA Loss in a Lineage

###############
 part 46
###############

In more distantly related vertebrates, genome size can vary considerably, apparently without a drastic effect on the organism or its number of genes. Thus, the chicken genome, at one billion nucleotide pairs, is only about one-third the size of the mammalian genome. An extreme example is the puffer fish, Fugu rubripes (Figure 4–70), which has a tiny genome for a vertebrate (0.4 billion nucleotide pairs compared to 1 billion or more for many other fish). The small size of the Fugu genome is largely due to the small size of its introns. Specifically, Fugu introns, as well as other noncoding segments of the Fugu genome, lack the repetitive DNA that makes up a large portion of the genomes of most well-studied vertebrates. Nevertheless, the positions of the Fugu introns between the exons of each gene are almost the same as in mammalian genomes (Figure 4–71).

While initially a mystery, we now have a simple explanation for such large differences in genome size between similar organisms: because all vertebrates experience a continuous process of DNA loss and DNA addition, the size of a genome merely depends on the balance between these opposing processes acting over millions of years. Suppose, for example, that in the lineage leading to Fugu, the rate of DNA addition happened to slow greatly. Over long periods of time, this would result in a major “cleansing” from this fish genome of those DNA sequences whose loss could be tolerated. The result is an unusually compact genome, relatively free of junk and clutter, but retaining through purifying selection the vertebrate DNA sequences that are functionally important. This makes Fugu, with its 400 million nucleotide pairs of DNA, a valuable resource for genome research aimed at understanding humans.

We Can Infer the Sequence of Some Ancient Genomes

###############
 part 47
###############

The genomes of ancestral organisms can be inferred, but most can never be directly observed. DNA is very stable compared with most organic molecules, but it is not perfectly stable, and its progressive degradation, even under the best circumstances, means that it is virtually impossible to extract sequence information from fossils that are more than a million years old. Although a modern organism such as the horseshoe crab looks remarkably similar to fossil ancestors that lived 200 million years ago, there is every reason to believe that the horseshoe-crab genome has been changing during all that time in much the same way as in other evolutionary lineages, and at a similar rate. Selection must have maintained key functional properties of the horseshoe-crab genome to account for the morphological stability of the lineage. However, comparisons between different present-day organisms show that the fraction of the genome subject to purifying selection is small; hence, it is fair to assume that the genome of the modern horseshoe crab, while preserving features critical for function, must differ greatly from that of its extinct ancestors, known to us only through the fossil record.

It is possible to get direct sequence information by examining DNA samples from ancient materials if these are not too old. In recent years, technical advances have allowed DNA sequencing from exceptionally well-preserved bone fragments that date from more than 100,000 years ago. Although any DNA this old will be imperfectly preserved, a sequence of the Neanderthal genome has been reconstructed from many millions of short DNA sequences, revealing—among other things—that our human ancestors interbred with Neanderthals in Europe and that modern humans have inherited specific genes from them (Figure 4–72). The average difference in DNA sequence between humans and Neanderthals shows that our two lineages diverged somewhere between 270,000 and 440,000 years ago, well before the time that humans are believed to have migrated out of Africa.

###############

But what about deciphering the genomes of much older ancestors, those for which no useful DNA samples can be isolated? For organisms that are as closely related as human and chimpanzee, we saw that this may not be difficult: reference to the gorilla sequence can be used to sort out which of the few sequence differences between human and chimpanzee are inherited from our common ancestor some 6 million years ago (see Figure 4–64). And for an ancestor that has produced a large number of different organisms alive today, the DNA sequences of many species can be compared simultaneously to unscramble much of the ancestral sequence, allowing scientists to derive DNA sequences much farther back in time. For example, from the genome sequences currently being obtained for dozens of modern placental mammals, it should be possible to infer much of the genome sequence of their 100 million-year-old common ancestor—the precursor of species as diverse as dog, mouse, rabbit, armadillo, and human (see Figure 4–66).

Multispecies Sequence Comparisons Identify Conserved DNA Sequences of Unknown Function

The mass of DNA sequence now in databases (hundreds of billions of nucleotide pairs) provides a rich resource that scientists can mine for many purposes. This information can be used not only to unscramble the evolutionary pathways that have led to modern organisms, but also to provide insights into how cells and organisms function. Perhaps the most remarkable discovery in this realm comes from the observation that a striking amount of DNA sequence that does not code for protein has been conserved during mammalian evolution (see Table 4–1, p. 184). This is most clearly revealed when we align and compare DNA synteny blocks from many different species, thereby identifying large numbers of so-called multispecies conserved sequences: some of these code for protein, but most of them do not (Figure 4–73).

Most of the noncoding conserved sequences discovered in this way turn out to be relatively short, containing between 50 and 200 nucleotide pairs. Among the most mysterious are the so-called “ultraconserved” noncoding sequences, exemplified by more than 5000 DNA segments over 100 nucleotides long that are exactly the same in human, mouse, and rat. Most have undergone little or no change since mammalian and bird ancestors diverged about 300 million years ago. The strict conservation implies that even though the sequences do not encode proteins, each nevertheless has an important function maintained by purifying selection. The puzzle is to unravel what those functions are.

###############
 part 49
###############

Many of the conserved sequences that do not code for protein are now known to produce untranslated RNA molecules, such as the thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are thought to have important functions in regulating gene transcription. As we shall also see in Chapter 7, others are short regions of DNA scattered throughout the genome that directly bind proteins involved in gene regulation. But it is uncertain how much of the conserved noncoding DNA can be accounted for in these ways, and the function of most of it remains a mystery. This enigma highlights how much more we need to learn about the fundamental biological mechanisms that operate in animals and other complex organisms, and its solution is certain to have profound consequences for medicine.

How can cell biologists tackle the mystery of noncoding conserved DNA? Traditionally, attempts to determine the function of a puzzling DNA sequence begin by looking at the consequences of its experimental disruption. But many DNA sequences that are crucial for an organism in the wild can be expected to have no noticeable effect on its phenotype under laboratory conditions: what is required for a mouse to survive in a laboratory cage is very much less than what is required  for it to succeed in nature. Moreover, calculations based on population genetics reveal that just a tiny selective advantage—less than a 0.1% difference in survival—can be enough to strongly favor retaining a particular DNA sequence over evolutionary time spans. One should therefore not be surprised to find that many DNA sequences that are ultraconserved can be deleted from the mouse genome without any noticeable effect on that mouse in a laboratory.

A second important approach for discovering the function of a mysterious noncoding DNA sequence uses biochemical techniques to identify proteins or RNA molecules that bind to it—and/or to any RNA molecules that it produces. Most of this task still lies before us, but a start has been made (see p. 435).

Changes in Previously Conserved Sequences Can Help Decipher Critical Steps in Evolution

###############
 part 50
###############

Given genome sequence information, we can tackle another intriguing question: What alterations in our DNA have made humans so different from other animals—or for that matter, what makes any individual species so different from its relatives? For example, as soon as both the human and the chimpanzee genome sequences became available, scientists began searching for DNA sequence changes that might account for the striking differences between us and chimpanzees. With 3.2 billion nucleotide pairs to compare in the two species, this might seem an impossible task. But the job was made much easier by confining the search to 35,000 clearly defined multispecies conserved sequences (a total of about 5 million nucleotide pairs), representing parts of the genome that are most likely to be functionally important. Though these sequences are conserved strongly, they are not conserved perfectly, and when the version in one species is compared with that in another they are generally found to have drifted apart by a small amount corresponding simply to the time elapsed since the last common ancestor. In a small proportion of cases, however, one sees signs of a sudden evolutionary spurt. For example, some DNA sequences that have been highly conserved in other mammalian species are found to have accumulated nucleotide changes exceptionally rapidly during the 6 million years of human evolution since we diverged from the chimpanzees. These human accelerated regions (HARs) are thought to reflect functions that have been especially important in making us different in some useful way.

About 50 such sites were identified in one study, one-fourth of which were located near genes associated with neural development. The sequence exhibiting the most rapid change (18 changes between human and chimpanzee, compared to only two changes between chimpanzee and chicken) was examined further and found to encode a 118-nucleotide noncoding RNA molecule, HAR1F (human accelerated region 1F), that is produced in the human cerebral cortex at a critical time during brain development. The function of this HAR1F RNA is not yet known, but findings of this type are stimulating research studies that may shed light on crucial features of the human brain.

###############
 part 51
###############

A related approach in the search for the important mutations that contributed to human evolution likewise begins with DNA sequences that have been conserved during mammalian evolution, but rather than screening for accelerated changes in individual nucleotides, it focuses instead on chromosome sites that have experienced deletions in the 6 million years since our lineage diverged from that of chimpanzees. More than 500 such sequences—conserved among other species but deleted in humans—have been discovered. Each deletion removes an average of 95 nucleotides of DNA sequence. Only one of these deletions affects a protein-coding region: the rest are thought to alter regions that affect how nearby genes are expressed, an expectation that has been experimentally confirmed in a few cases. A large proportion of the presumed regulatory regions identified in this way lie near genes that affect neural function and/or near genes involved in steroid signaling, suggesting that changes in the nervous system and in immune or reproductive functions have played an especially important role in human evolution. 

Mutations in the DNA Sequences That Control Gene Expression Have Driven Many of the Evolutionary Changes in Vertebrates

###############
 part 52
###############

The vast hoard of genomic sequence data now being accumulated can be explored in many other ways to reveal events that happened even hundreds of millions of years ago. For example, one can attempt to trace the origins of the regulatory elements in DNA that have played critical parts in vertebrate evolution. One such study began with the identification of nearly 3 million noncoding sequences, averaging 28 base pairs in length, that have been conserved in recent vertebrate evolution while being absent in more ancient ancestors. Each of these special non-coding sequences is likely to represent a functional innovation peculiar to a particular branch of the vertebrate family tree, and most of them are thought to consist of regulatory DNA that governs the expression of a neighboring gene. Given full genome sequences, one can identify the genes that lie closest and thus appear most likely to have fallen under the sway of these novel regulatory elements. By comparing many different species, with known divergence times, one can also estimate when each such regulatory element came into existence as a conserved feature. The findings suggest remarkable evolutionary differences between the various functional classes of genes (Figure 4–74). Conserved regulatory elements that originated early in vertebrate evolution—that is, more than about 300 million years ago, which is when the mammalian lineage split from the lineage leading to birds and reptiles—seem to be mostly associated with genes that code for transcription regulator proteins and for proteins with roles in organizing embryonic development. Then came an era when the regulatory DNA innovations arose next to genes coding for receptors for extracellular signals. Finally, over the course of the past 100 million years, the regulatory innovations seem to have been concentrated in the neighborhood of genes coding for proteins (such as protein kinases) that function to modify other proteins post-translationally.

Many questions remain to be answered about these phenomena and what they mean. One possible interpretation is that the logic—the circuit diagram—of the gene regulatory network in vertebrates was established early, and that more recent evolutionary change has mainly occurred through the tuning of quantitative parameters. This could help to explain why, among the mammals, for example, the basic body plan—the topology of the tissues and organs—has been largely conserved.

Gene Duplication Also Provides an Important Source of Genetic Novelty During Evolution

###############
 part 53
###############

Evolution depends on the creation of new genes, as well as on the modification of those that already exist. How does this occur? When we compare organisms that seem very different—a primate with a rodent, for example, or a mouse with a fish—we rarely encounter genes in the one species that have no homolog in the other. Genes without homologous counterparts are relatively scarce even when we compare such divergent organisms as a mammal and a worm. On the other hand, we frequently find gene families that have different numbers of members in different species. To create such families, genes have been repeatedly duplicated, and the copies have then diverged to take on new functions that often vary from one species to another.

Gene duplication occurs at high rates in all evolutionary lineages, contributing to the vigorous process of DNA addition discussed previously. In a detailed study of spontaneous duplications in yeast, duplications of 50,000 to 250,000 nucleotide pairs were commonly observed, most of which were tandemly repeated. These appeared to result from DNA replication errors that led to the inexact repair of double-strand chromosome breaks. A comparison of the human and chimpanzee genomes reveals that, since the time that these two organisms diverged, such segmental duplications have added about 5 million nucleotide pairs to each genome every million years, with an average duplication size being about 50,000 nucleotide pairs (although there are some duplications five times larger). In fact, if one counts nucleotides, duplication events have created more differences between our two species than have single-nucleotide substitutions.

Duplicated Genes Diverge

What is the fate of newly duplicated genes? In most cases, there is presumed to be little or no selection—at least initially—to maintain the duplicated state since either copy can provide an equivalent function. Hence, many duplication events are likely to be followed by loss-of-function mutations in one or the other gene. This cycle would functionally restore the one-gene state that preceded the duplication. Indeed, there are many examples in contemporary genomes where one copy of a duplicated gene can be seen to have become irreversibly inactivated by multiple mutations. Over time, the sequence similarity between such a pseudogene and the functional gene whose duplication produced it would be expected to be eroded by the accumulation of many mutations in the pseudogene—the homologous relationship eventually becoming undetectable.

###############
 part 54
###############

An alternative fate for gene duplications is for both copies to remain functional, while diverging in their sequence and pattern of expression, thus taking on different roles. This process of “duplication and divergence” almost certainly explains the presence of large families of genes with related functions in biologically complex organisms, and it is thought to play a critical role in the evolution of increased biological complexity. An examination of many different eukaryotic genomes suggests that the probability that any particular gene will undergo a duplication event that spreads to most or all individuals in a species is approximately 1 percent every million years.

Whole-genome duplications offer particularly dramatic examples of the duplication–divergence cycle. A whole-genome duplication can occur quite simply: all that is required is one round of genome replication in a germ-line cell lineage without a corresponding cell division. Initially, the chromosome number simply doubles. Such abrupt increases in the ploidy of an organism are common, particularly in fungi and plants. After a whole-genome duplication, all genes exist as duplicate copies. However, unless the duplication event occurred so recently that there has been little time for subsequent alterations in genome structure, the results of a series of segmental duplications—occurring at different times—are hard to distinguish from the end product of a whole-genome duplication. In mammals, for example, the role of whole-genome duplications versus a series of piecemeal duplications of DNA segments is quite uncertain. Nevertheless, it is clear that a great deal of gene duplication has occurred in the distant past.

Analysis of the genome of the zebrafish, in which at least one whole-genome duplication is thought to have occurred hundreds of millions of years ago, has cast some light on the process of gene duplication and divergence. Although many duplicates of zebrafish genes appear to have been lost by mutation, a significant fraction—perhaps as many as 30–50%—have diverged functionally while both copies have remained active. In many cases, the most obvious functional difference between the duplicated genes is that they are expressed in different tissues or at different stages of development. One attractive theory to explain such an end result imagines that different, mildly deleterious mutations occur quickly in both copies of a duplicated gene set. For example, one copy might lose expression in a particular tissue as a result of a regulatory mutation, while the other copy loses expression in a second tissue. Following such an occurrence, both gene copies would be required to provide the full range of functions that were once supplied by a single gene; hence, both copies would now be protected from loss through inactivating mutations. Over a longer period, each copy could then undergo further changes through which it could acquire new, specialized features.

The Evolution of the Globin Gene Family Shows How DNA Duplications Contribute to the Evolution of Organisms

The globin gene family provides an especially good example of how DNA duplication generates new proteins, because its evolutionary history has been worked out particularly well. The unmistakable similarities in amino acid sequence and structure among the present-day globins indicate that they all must derive from a common ancestral gene, even though some are now encoded by widely separated genes in the mammalian genome.

We can reconstruct some of the past events that produced the various types of oxygen-carrying hemoglobin molecules by considering the different forms of the protein in organisms at different positions on the tree of life. A molecule like hemoglobin was necessary to allow multicellular animals to grow to a large size, since large animals cannot simply rely on the diffusion of oxygen through the body surface to oxygenate their tissues adequately. But oxygen plays a vital part in the life of nearly all living organisms, and oxygen-binding proteins homologous to hemoglobin can be recognized even in plants, fungi, and bacteria. In animals, the most primitive oxygen-carrying molecule is a globin polypeptide chain of about 150 amino acids that is found in many marine worms, insects, and primitive fish. The hemoglobin molecule in more complex vertebrates, however, is composed of two kinds of globin chains. It appears that about 500 million years ago, during the continuing evolution of fish, a series of gene mutations and duplications occurred. These events established two slightly different globin genes in the genome of each individual, coding for α- and β-globin chains that associate to form a hemoglobin molecule consisting of two α chains and two β chains (Figure 4–75). The four oxygen-binding sites in the α2β2 molecule interact, allowing a cooperative allosteric change in the molecule as it binds and releases oxygen, which enables hemoglobin to take up and release oxygen more efficiently than the single-chain version.

Still later, during the evolution of mammals, the β-chain gene apparently underwent duplication and mutation to give rise to a second β-like chain that is synthesized specifically in the fetus. The resulting hemoglobin molecule has a higher affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin and thus helps in the transfer of oxygen from the mother to the fetus. The gene for the new β-like chain subsequently duplicated and mutated again to produce two new genes, ε and γ, the ε chain being produced earlier in development (to form α2ε2) than the fetal γ chain, which forms α2γ2. A duplication of the adult β-chain gene occurred still later, during primate evolution, to give rise to a δ-globin gene and thus to a minor form of hemoglobin (α2δ2) that is found only in adult primates (Figure 4–76).

###############
 part 56
###############

Each of these duplicated genes has been modified by point mutations that affect the properties of the final hemoglobin molecule, as well as by changes in regulatory regions that determine the timing and level of expression of the gene. As a result, each globin is made in different amounts at different times of human development.

The history of these gene duplications is reflected in the arrangement of hemoglobin genes in the genome. In the human genome, the genes that arose from the original β gene are arranged as a series of homologous DNA sequences located within 50,000 nucleotide pairs of one another on a single chromosome. A similar cluster of human α-globin genes is located on a separate chromosome. Not only other mammals, but birds too have their α- and β-globin gene clusters on separate chromosomes. In the frog Xenopus, however, they are together, suggesting that a chromosome translocation event in the lineage of birds and mammals separated the two gene clusters about 300 million years ago, soon after our ancestors diverged from amphibians (see Figure 4–76).

There are several duplicated globin DNA sequences in the α- and β-globin gene clusters that are not functional genes but pseudogenes. These have a close sequence similarity to the functional genes but have been disabled by mutations that prevent their expression as functional proteins. The existence of such pseudogenes makes it clear that, as expected, not every DNA duplication leads to a new functional gene.

Genes Encoding New Proteins Can Be Created by the Recombination of Exons

The role of DNA duplication in evolution is not confined to the expansion of gene families. It can also act on a smaller scale to create single genes by stringing together short duplicated segments of DNA. The proteins encoded by genes generated in this way can be recognized by the presence of repeating similar protein domains, which are covalently linked to one another in series. The immunoglobulins (Figure 4–77), for example, as well as most fibrous proteins (such as collagens) are encoded by genes that have evolved by repeated duplications of a primordial DNA sequence.

###############
 part 57
###############

In genes that have evolved in this way, as well as in many other genes, each separate exon often encodes an individual protein folding unit, or domain. It is believed that the organization of DNA coding sequences as a series of such exons separated by long introns has greatly facilitated the evolution of new proteins. The duplications necessary to form a single gene coding for a protein with repeating domains, for example, can easily occur by breaking and rejoining the DNA anywhere in the long introns on either side of an exon; without introns there would be only a few sites in the original gene at which a recombinational exchange between DNA molecules could duplicate the domain and not disrupt it. By enabling the duplication to occur by recombination at many potential sites rather than just a few, introns increase the probability of a favorable duplication event.

More generally, we know from genome sequences that the various parts of genes—both their individual exons and their regulatory elements—have served as modular elements that have been duplicated and moved about the genome to create the great diversity of living things. Thus, for example, many present-day proteins are formed as a patchwork of domains from different origins, reflecting their complex evolutionary history (see Figure 3–17).

Neutral Mutations Often Spread to Become Fixed in a Population, with a Probability That Depends on Population Size

In comparisons between two species that have diverged from one another by millions of years, it makes little difference which individuals from each species are compared. For example, typical human and chimpanzee DNA sequences differ from one another by about 1%. In contrast, when the same region of the genome is sampled from two randomly chosen humans, the differences are typically about 0.1%. For more distantly related organisms, the interspecies differences outshine intraspecies variation even more dramatically. However, each “fixed difference” between the human and the chimpanzee (in other words, each difference that is now characteristic of all or nearly all individuals of each species) started out as a new mutation in a single individual. If the size of the interbreeding population in which the mutation occurred is N, the initial allele frequency for a new mutation would be 1/(2 N) for a diploid organism. How does such a rare mutation become fixed in the population, and hence become a characteristic of the species rather than of a few scattered individuals?

###############
 part 58
###############

The answer to this question depends on the functional consequences of the mutation. If the mutation has a significantly deleterious effect, it will simply be eliminated by purifying selection and will not become fixed. (In the most extreme case, the individual carrying the mutation will die without producing progeny.) Conversely, the rare mutations that confer a major reproductive advantage on individuals who inherit them can spread rapidly in the population. Because humans reproduce sexually and genetic recombination occurs each time a gamete is formed (discussed in Chapter 5), the genome of each individual who has inherited the mutation will be a unique recombinational mosaic of segments inherited from a large number of ancestors. The selected mutation along with a modest amount of neighboring sequence—ultimately inherited from the individual in which the mutation occurred—will simply be one piece of this huge mosaic.

The great majority of mutations that are not harmful are not beneficial either. These selectively neutral mutations can also spread and become fixed in a population, and they make a large contribution to evolutionary change in genomes. For example, as we saw earlier, they account for most of the DNA sequence differences between apes and humans. The spread of neutral mutations is not as rapid as the spread of the rare strongly advantageous mutations. It depends on a random variation in the number of mutation-bearing progeny produced by each mutation-bearing individual, causing changes in the relative frequency of the mutant allele in the population. Through a sort of “random walk” process, the mutant allele may eventually become extinct, or it may become commonplace. This can be modeled mathematically for an idealized interbreeding population, on the assumption of constant population size and random mating, as well as selective neutrality for the mutations. While neither of the first two assumptions is a good description of human population history, study of this idealized case reveals the general principles in a clear and simple way.

###############
 part 59
###############

When a new neutral mutation occurs in a population of constant size N that is undergoing random mating, the probability that it will ultimately become fixed is approximately 1/(2 N). This is because there are 2 N copies of the gene in the diploid population, and each of them has an equal chance of becoming the predominant version in the long run. For those mutations that do become fixed, the mathematics shows that the average time to fixation is approximately 4 N generations. Detailed analyses of data on human genetic variation have suggested an ancestral population size of approximately 10,000 at the time when the current pattern of genetic variation was largely established. With a population that has reached this size, the probability that a new, selectively neutral mutation would become fixed is small (1/20,000), while the average time to fixation would be on the order of 800,000 years (assuming a 20-year generation time). Thus, while we know that the human population has grown enormously since the development of agriculture approximately 15,000 years ago, most of the present-day set of common human genetic variants reflects the mixture of variants that was already present long before this time, when the human population was still small.

Similar arguments explain another phenomenon with important practical implications for genetic counseling. In an isolated community descended from a small group of founders, such as the people of Iceland or the Jews of Eastern Europe, genetic variants that are rare in the human population as a whole can often be present at a high frequency, even if those variants are mildly deleterious (Figure 4–78).

A Great Deal Can Be Learned from Analyses of the Variation Among Humans

Even though the common variant gene alleles among modern humans originate from variants present in a comparatively tiny group of ancestors, the total number of variants now encountered, including those that are individually rare, is very large. New neutral mutations are constantly occurring and accumulating, even though no single one of them has had enough time to become fixed in the vast modern human population.

From detailed comparisons of the DNA sequences of a large number of modern humans located around the globe, scientists can estimate how many generations have elapsed since the origin of a particular neutral mutation. From such data, it has been possible to map the routes of ancient human migrations. For example, by combining this type of genetic analysis with archaeological findings, scientists have been able to deduce the most probable routes that our ancestors took when they left Africa 60,000 to 80,000 years ago (Figure 4–79).

###############
 part 60
###############

We have been focusing on mutations that affect a single gene, but these are not the only source of variation. Another source, perhaps even more important but missed for many years, lies in the many duplications and deletions of large blocks of human DNA. When one compares any individual human with the standard reference genome in the database, one will generally find roughly 100 differences involving gain or loss of long sequence blocks, totaling perhaps 3 million nucleotide pairs. Some of these copy number variations (CNVs) will be very common, presumably reflecting relatively ancient origins, while others will be present in only a small minority of people (Figure 4–80). On average, nearly half of the CNVs contain known genes. CNVs have been implicated in many human traits, including color blindness, infertility, hypertension, and a wide variety of disease susceptibilities. In retrospect, this type of variation is not surprising, given the prominent role of DNA addition and DNA loss in vertebrate evolution.

The intraspecies variations that have been most extensively characterized, however, are single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These are simply points in the genome sequence where one large fraction of the human population has one nucleotide, while another substantial fraction has another. To qualify as a polymorphism, the variants must be common enough to give a reasonably high probability that the genomes of two randomly chosen individuals will differ at the given site; a probability of 1% is commonly chosen as the cutoff. Two human genomes sampled from the modern world population at random will differ at approximately 2.5 × 106 such sites (1 per 1300 nucleotide pairs). As will be described in the overview of genetics in Chapter 8, SNPs in the human genome can be extremely useful for genetic mapping analyses, in which one attempts to associate specific traits (phenotypes) with specific DNA sequences for medical or scientific purposes (see p. 493). But while useful as genetic markers, there is good evidence that most of these SNPs have little or no effect on human fitness. This is as expected, since deleterious variants will have been selected against during human evolution and, unlike SNPs, should therefore be rare.

###############
 part 61
###############

Against the background of ordinary SNPs inherited from our prehistoric ancestors, certain sequences with exceptionally high mutation rates stand out. A dramatic example is provided by CA repeats, which are ubiquitous in the human genome and in the genomes of other eukaryotes. Sequences with the motif (CA)n are replicated with relatively low fidelity because of a slippage that occurs between the template and the newly synthesized strands during DNA replication; hence, the precise value of n can vary over a considerable range from one genome to the next. These repeats make ideal DNA-based genetic markers, since most humans are heterozygous, having inherited one repeat length (n) from their mother and a different repeat length from their father. While the value of n changes sufficiently rarely that most parent–child transmissions propagate CA repeats faithfully, the changes are sufficiently frequent to maintain high levels of heterozygosity in the human population. These and some other simple repeats that display exceptionally high variability therefore provide the basis for identifying individuals by DNA analysis in crime investigations, paternity suits, and other forensic applications (see Figure 8–39).

While most of the SNPs and CNVs in the human genome sequence are thought to have little or no effect on phenotype, a subset of the genome sequence variations must be responsible for the heritable aspects of human individuality. We know that even a single nucleotide change that alters one amino acid in a protein can cause a serious disease, as for example in sickle-cell anemia, which is caused by such a mutation in hemoglobin (Movie 4.3). We also know that gene dosage—a doubling or halving of the copy number of some genes—can have a profound effect on development by altering the level of gene product, as can changes in regulatory DNA sequences. There is therefore every reason to suppose that some of the many differences between any two human beings will have substantial  effects on human health, physiology, behavior, and physique. A major challenge in human genetics is to recognize those relatively few variations that are functionally important against a large background of variation that is neutral and of no consequence.

Summary

Comparisons of the nucleotide sequences of present-day genomes have revolutionized our understanding of gene and genome evolution. Because of the extremely high fidelity of DNA replication and DNA repair processes, random errors in maintaining the nucleotide sequences in genomes occur so rarely that only about one nucleotide in a thousand is altered in every million years in any particular eukaryotic line of descent. Not surprisingly, therefore, a comparison of human and chimpanzee chromosomes—which are separated by about 6 million years of evolution—reveals very few changes. Not only are our genes essentially the same, but their order on each chromosome is almost identical. Although a substantial number of segmental duplications and segmental deletions have occurred in the past 6 million years, even the positions of the transposable elements that make up a major portion of our noncoding DNA are mostly unchanged. When one compares the genomes of two more distantly related organisms—such as a human and a mouse, separated by about 80 million years—one finds many more changes. Now the effects of natural selection can be clearly seen: through purifying selection, essential nucleotide sequences—both in regulatory regions and in coding sequences (exons)—have been highly conserved. In contrast, nonessential sequences (for example, much of the DNA in introns) have been altered to such an extent that one can no longer see any family resemblance. Because of purifying selection, the comparison of the genome sequences of multiple related species is an especially powerful way to find DNA sequences with important functions. Although about 5% of the human genome has been conserved as a result of purifying selection, the function of the majority of this DNA (tens of thousands of multispecies conserved sequences) remains mysterious. Future experiments characterizing its functions should teach us many new lessons about vertebrate biology. Other sequence comparisons show that a great deal of the genetic complexity of present-day organisms is due to the expansion of ancient gene families. DNA duplication followed by sequence divergence has clearly been a major source of genetic novelty during evolution. On a more recent time scale, the genomes of any two humans will differ from each other both because of nucleotide substitutions (single-nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs) and because of inherited DNA gains and DNA losses that cause copy number variations (CNVs). Understanding the effects of these differences will improve both medicine and our understanding of human biology.

What we don’t know

• How many different types of chromatin structure are important for cells? How is each of these structures established and maintained, and which ones tend to be inherited following DNA replication?
• Why are there so many different chromatin remodeling complexes in cells? What are their essential roles, and how do they get loaded onto chromatin at specific places and at specific times?
• How do chromosomal loops form during interphase, and what happens to these loops in condensed mitotic chromosomes?
• What genetic changes made us uniquely human? What further aspects of our recent evolutionary development can be reconstructed by sequencing DNA from remains of ancient hominids?
• How much of the enormous complexity that we find in cell biology is unnecessary, having evolved by random drift?
