Note to the Reader

Structure of the Book

Although the chapters of this book can be read independently of one another, they are arranged in a logical sequence of five parts. The first three chapters of Part I cover elementary principles and basic biochemistry. They can serve either as an introduction for those who have not studied biochemistry or as a refresher course for those who have. Part II deals with the storage, expression, and transmission of genetic information. Part III presents the principles of the main experimental methods for investigating and analyzing cells; here, a new section entitled “Mathematical Analysis of Cell Functions” in Chapter 8 provides an extra dimension in our understanding of cell regulation and function. Part IV describes the internal organization of the cell. Part V follows the behavior of cells in multicellular systems, starting with development of multicellular organisms and concluding with chapters on pathogens and infection and on the innate and adaptive immune systems.

End-of-Chapter Problems

A selection of problems, written by John Wilson and Tim Hunt, appears in the text at the end of each chapter. New to this edition are problems for the last four chapters on multicellular organisms. The complete solutions to all of these problems can be found in Molecular Biology of the Cell, Sixth Edition: The Problems Book.

References

A concise list of selected references is included at the end of each chapter. These are arranged in alphabetical order under the main chapter section headings. These references sometimes include the original papers in which important discoveries were first reported.

Glossary Terms

Throughout the book, boldface type has been used to highlight key terms at the point in a chapter where the main discussion occurs. Italic type is used to set off important terms with a lesser degree of emphasis. At the end of the book is an expanded glossary, covering technical terms that are part of the common currency of cell biology; it should be the first resort for a reader who encounters an unfamiliar term. The complete glossary as well as a set of flashcards is available on the Student Website.

Nomenclature for Genes and Proteins

Each species has its own conventions for naming genes; the only common feature is that they are always set in italics. In some species (such as humans), gene names are spelled out all in capital letters; in other species (such as zebrafish), all in lowercase; in yet others (most mouse genes), with the first letter in uppercase and rest in lowercase; or (as in Drosophila) with different combinations of uppercase and lowercase, according to whether the first mutant allele to be discovered produced a dominant or recessive phenotype. Conventions for naming protein products are equally varied.

This typographical chaos drives everyone crazy. It is not just tiresome and absurd; it is also unsustainable. We cannot independently define a fresh convention for each of the next few million species whose genes we may wish to study Moreover, there are many occasions, especially in a book such as this, where we need to refer to a gene generically—without specifying the mouse version, the human version, the chick version, or the hippopotamus version—because they are all equivalent for the purposes of our discussion. What convention then should we use?

We have decided in this book to cast aside the different conventions that are used in individual species and follow a uniform rule: we write all gene names, like the names of people and places, with the first letter in uppercase and the rest in lowercase, but all in italics, thus: Apc, Bazooka, Cdc2, Dishevelled, Egl1. The corresponding protein, where it is named after the gene, will be written in the same way, but in roman rather than italic letters: Apc, Bazooka, Cdc2, Dishevelled, Egl1. When it is necessary to specify the organism, this can be done with a prefix to the gene name.

For completeness, we list a few further details of naming rules that we shall follow. In some instances, an added letter in the gene name is traditionally used to distinguish between genes that are related by function or evolution; for those genes, we put that letter in uppercase if it is usual to do so (LacZ, RecA, HoxA4). We use no hyphen to separate added letters or numbers from the rest of the name. Proteins are more of a problem. Many of them have names in their own right, assigned to them before the gene was named. Such protein names take many forms, although most of them traditionally begin with a lowercase letter (actin, hemoglobin, catalase), like the names of ordinary substances (cheese, nylon), unless they are acronyms (such as GFP, for Green Fluorescent Protein, or BMP4, for Bone Morphogenetic Protein #4). To force all such protein names into a uniform style would do too much violence to established usages, and we shall simply write them in the traditional way (actin, GFP, and so on). For the corresponding gene names in all these cases, we shall nevertheless follow our standard rule: Actin, Hemoglobin, Catalase, Bmp4, Gfp. Occasionally in our book we need to highlight a protein name by setting it in italics for emphasis; the intention will generally be clear from the context.

For those who wish to know them, the table below shows some of the official conventions for individual species—conventions that we shall mostly violate in this book, in the manner shown.

The Problems Book is designed to help students appreciate the ways in which experiments and simple calculations can lead to an understanding of how cells work. It provides problems to accompany Chapters 1–20 of Molecular Biology of the Cell. Each chapter of problems is divided into sections that correspond to those of the main textbook and review key terms, test for understanding basic concepts, pose research-based problems, and now include MCAT-style questions which help students to prepare for standardized medical school admission tests. Molecular Biology of the Cell, Sixth Edition: The Problems Book should be useful for homework assignments and as a basis for class discussion. It could even provide ideas for exam questions. Solutions for all of the problems are provided in the book. Solutions for the end-of-chapter problems for Chapters 1–24 in the main textbook are also found in The Problems Book.

RESOURCES FOR INSTRUCTORS AND STUDENTS

The teaching and learning resources for instructors and students are available online. The instructor’s resources are password-protected and available only to adopting instructors. The student resources are available to everyone. We hope these resources will enhance student learning and make it easier for instructors to prepare dynamic lectures and activities for the classroom.

Instructor Resources

Instructor Resources are available on the Garland Science Instructor’s Resource Site, located at www.garlandscience.com/instructors. The website provides access not only to the teaching resources for this book but also to all other Garland Science textbooks. Adopting instructors can obtain access to the site from their sales representative or by emailing science@garland.com.

Question Bank
Written by Hossein Amiri, University of California, Santa Cruz, this greatly expanded question bank includes a variety of question formats: multiple choice, short answer, fill-in-the-blank, true-false, and matching. There are 35–60 questions per chapter, and a large number of the multiple-choice questions will be suitable for use with personal response systems (that is, clickers). The Question Bank was created with the philosophy that a good exam should do much more than simply test students’ ability to memorize information; it should require them to reflect upon and integrate information as a part of a sound understanding. This resource provides a comprehensive sampling of questions that can be used either directly or as inspiration for instructors to write their own test questions.

Diploma® Test Generator Software
The questions from the Question Bank have been loaded into the Diploma Test Generator software. The software is easy to use and can scramble questions to create multiple tests. Questions are organized by chapter and type and can be additionally categorized by the instructor according to difficulty or subject. Existing questions can be edited and new ones added. The Test Generator is compatible with several course management systems, including Blackboard®.
