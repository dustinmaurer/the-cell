<voice name="en-US-ChristopherNeural">Just as we were completing this edition, Julian Lewis, our coauthor, friend, and colleague, finally succumbed to the cancer that he had fought so heroically for ten years. Starting in 1979, Julian made major contributions to all six editions, and, as our most elegant wordsmith, he elevated and enhanced both the style and tone of all the many chapters he touched. Noted for his careful scholarly approach, clarity and simplicity were at the core of his writing. Julian is irreplaceable, and we will all deeply miss his friendship and collaboration. We dedicate this Sixth Edition to his memory</voice></speak>
