Preface, part 1,"Preface
Since the last edition of this book appeared, more than five million scientific papers have been published. There has been a parallel increase in the quantity of digital information: new data on genome sequences, protein interactions, molecular structures, and gene expression—all stored in vast databases. The challenge, for both scientists and textbook writers, is to convert this overwhelming amount of information into an accessible and up-to-date understanding of how cells work.
Help comes from a large increase in the number of review articles that attempt to make raw material easier to digest, although the vast majority of these reviews are still quite narrowly focused. Meanwhile, a rapidly growing collection of online resources tries to convince us that understanding is only a few mouse-clicks away. In some areas this change in the way we access knowledge has been highly successful—in discovering the latest information about our own medical problems, for example. But to understand something of the beauty and complexity of how living cells work, one needs more than just a wiki-this or wiki-that; it is enormously hard to identify the valuable and enduring gems from so much confusing landfill. Much more effective is a carefully wrought narrative that leads logically and progressively through the key ideas, components, and experiments in such a way that readers can build for themselves a memorable, conceptual framework for cell biology— a framework that will allow them to critically evaluate all of the new science and, more importantly, to understand it. That is what we have tried to do in Molecular Biology of the Cell.
In preparing this new edition, we have inevitably had to make some difficult decisions. In order to incorporate exciting new discoveries, while at the same time keeping the book portable, much has had to be excised. We have added new sections, such as those on new RNA functions, advances in stem cell biology, new methods for studying proteins and genes and for imaging cells, advances in the genetics and treatment of cancer, and timing, growth control, and morphogenesis in development.
The chemistry of cells is extremely complex, and any list of cell parts and their interactions—no matter how complete—will leave huge gaps in our understanding. We now realize that to produce convincing explanations of cell behavior will require quantitative information about cells that is coupled to sophisticated mathematical/computational approaches—some not yet invented. As a consequence, an emerging goal for cell biologists is to shift their studies more toward quantitative description and mathematical deduction. We highlight this approach and some of its methods in a new section at the end of Chapter 8.","<!--ID=B7267351-473F-409D-9765-754A8EBCDE05;Version=1|{""VoiceNameToIdMapItems"":[{""Name"":""Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, ChristopherNeural)"",""ShortName"":""en-US-ChristopherNeural"",""Locale"":""en-US"",""Id"":""4337134d-4e59-48d1-af56-f4e96771bda1"",""VoiceType"":""StandardVoice""}]}-->

Preface, part 2,"Faced with the immensity of what we have learned about cell biology, it might be tempting for a student to imagine that there is little left to discover. In fact, the more we find out about cells, the more new questions emerge. To emphasize that our understanding of cell biology is incomplete, we have highlighted some of the major gaps in our knowledge by including What We Don’t Know at the end of each chapter. These brief lists include only a tiny sample of the critical unanswered questions and challenges for the next generation of scientists. We derive great pleasure from the knowledge that some of our readers will provide future answers.
The more than 1500 illustrations have been designed to create a parallel narrative, closely interwoven with the text. We have increased their consistency between chapters, particularly in the use of color and of common icons; membrane pumps and channels are a good example. To avoid interruptions to the text, some material has been moved into new, readily accessible panels. Most of the important protein structures depicted have now been redrawn and consistently colored. In each case, we now provide the corresponding Protein Data Bank (PDB) code for the protein, which can be used to access online tools that provide more information about it, such as those on the RCSB PDB website (www.rcsb.org). These connections allow readers of the book to explore more fully the proteins that lie at the core of cell biology.
John Wilson and Tim Hunt have again contributed their distinctive and imaginative problems to help students gain a more active understanding of the text. The problems emphasize quantitative approaches and encourage critical thinking about published experiments; they are now present at the end of all chapters. The answers to these problems, plus more than 1800 additional problems and solutions, all appear in the companion volume that John and Tim have written, Molecular Biology of the Cell, Sixth Edition: The Problems Book.
We live in a world that presents us with many complex issues related to cell biology: biodiversity, climate change, food security, environmental degradation, resource depletion, and human disease. We hope that our textbook will help the reader better understand and possibly contribute to meeting these challenges. Knowledge and understanding bring the power to intervene.","<!--ID=B7267351-473F-409D-9765-754A8EBCDE05;Version=1|{""VoiceNameToIdMapItems"":[{""Name"":""Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, ChristopherNeural)"",""ShortName"":""en-US-ChristopherNeural"",""Locale"":""en-US"",""Id"":""4337134d-4e59-48d1-af56-f4e96771bda1"",""VoiceType"":""StandardVoice""}]}-->

Reader Note, part 1,"Note to the Reader
Structure of the Book
Although the chapters of this book can be read independently of one another, they are arranged in a logical sequence of five parts. The first three chapters of Part I cover elementary principles and basic biochemistry. They can serve either as an introduction for those who have not studied biochemistry or as a refresher course for those who have. Part II deals with the storage, expression, and transmission of genetic information. Part III presents the principles of the main experimental methods for investigating and analyzing cells; here, a new section entitled “Mathematical Analysis of Cell Functions” in Chapter 8 provides an extra dimension in our understanding of cell regulation and function. Part IV describes the internal organization of the cell. Part V follows the behavior of cells in multicellular systems, starting with development of multicellular organisms and concluding with chapters on pathogens and infection and on the innate and adaptive immune systems.
End-of-Chapter Problems
A selection of problems, written by John Wilson and Tim Hunt, appears in the text at the end of each chapter. New to this edition are problems for the last four chapters on multicellular organisms. The complete solutions to all of these problems can be found in Molecular Biology of the Cell, Sixth Edition: The Problems Book.
References
A concise list of selected references is included at the end of each chapter. These are arranged in alphabetical order under the main chapter section headings. These references sometimes include the original papers in which important discoveries were first reported.
Glossary Terms
Throughout the book, boldface type has been used to highlight key terms at the point in a chapter where the main discussion occurs. Italic type is used to set off important terms with a lesser degree of emphasis. At the end of the book is an expanded glossary, covering technical terms that are part of the common currency of cell biology; it should be the first resort for a reader who encounters an unfamiliar term. The complete glossary as well as a set of flashcards is available on the Student Website.
Nomenclature for Genes and Proteins
Each species has its own conventions for naming genes; the only common feature is that they are always set in italics. In some species (such as humans), gene names are spelled out all in capital letters; in other species (such as zebrafish), all in lowercase; in yet others (most mouse genes), with the first letter in uppercase and rest in lowercase; or (as in Drosophila) with different combinations of uppercase and lowercase, according to whether the first mutant allele to be discovered produced a dominant or recessive phenotype. Conventions for naming protein products are equally varied.","<!--ID=B7267351-473F-409D-9765-754A8EBCDE05;Version=1|{""VoiceNameToIdMapItems"":[{""Name"":""Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, ChristopherNeural)"",""ShortName"":""en-US-ChristopherNeural"",""Locale"":""en-US"",""Id"":""4337134d-4e59-48d1-af56-f4e96771bda1"",""VoiceType"":""StandardVoice""}]}-->

Reader Note, part 2,"This typographical chaos drives everyone crazy. It is not just tiresome and absurd; it is also unsustainable. We cannot independently define a fresh convention for each of the next few million species whose genes we may wish to study Moreover, there are many occasions, especially in a book such as this, where we need to refer to a gene generically—without specifying the mouse version, the human version, the chick version, or the hippopotamus version—because they are all equivalent for the purposes of our discussion. What convention then should we use?
We have decided in this book to cast aside the different conventions that are used in individual species and follow a uniform rule: we write all gene names, like the names of people and places, with the first letter in uppercase and the rest in lowercase, but all in italics, thus: Apc, Bazooka, Cdc2, Dishevelled, Egl1. The corresponding protein, where it is named after the gene, will be written in the same way, but in roman rather than italic letters: Apc, Bazooka, Cdc2, Dishevelled, Egl1. When it is necessary to specify the organism, this can be done with a prefix to the gene name.
For completeness, we list a few further details of naming rules that we shall follow. In some instances, an added letter in the gene name is traditionally used to distinguish between genes that are related by function or evolution; for those genes, we put that letter in uppercase if it is usual to do so (Lac Z, Rec A, Hox A4). We use no hyphen to separate added letters or numbers from the rest of the name. Proteins are more of a problem. Many of them have names in their own right, assigned to them before the gene was named. Such protein names take many forms, although most of them traditionally begin with a lowercase letter (actin, hemoglobin, catalase), like the names of ordinary substances (cheese, nylon), unless they are acronyms (such as GFP, for Green Fluorescent Protein, or BMP4, for Bone Morphogenetic Protein #4). To force all such protein names into a uniform style would do too much violence to established usages, and we shall simply write them in the traditional way (actin, GFP, and so on). For the corresponding gene names in all these cases, we shall nevertheless follow our standard rule: Actin, Hemoglobin, Catalase, Bmp4, Gfp. Occasionally in our book we need to highlight a protein name by setting it in italics for emphasis; the intention will generally be clear from the context.
For those who wish to know them, the table below shows some of the official conventions for individual species—conventions that we shall mostly violate in this book, in the manner shown.

This document provides an overview to the multimedia available for students and instructors and contains the text of the voice-over narration for all of the movies.
Question Bank
Written by Hossein Amiri, University of California, Santa Cruz, this greatly expanded question bank includes a variety of question formats: multiple choice, short answer, fill-in-the-blank, true-false, and matching. There are 35–60 questions per chapter, and a large number of the multiple-choice questions will be suitable for use with personal response systems (that is, clickers). The Question Bank was created with the philosophy that a good exam should do much more than simply test students’ ability to memorize information; it should require them to reflect upon and integrate information as a part of a sound understanding. This resource provides a comprehensive sampling of questions that can be used either directly or as inspiration for instructors to write their own test questions.
Diploma Test Generator Software
The questions from the Question Bank have been loaded into the Diploma Test Generator software. The software is easy to use and can scramble questions to create multiple tests. Questions are organized by chapter and type and can be additionally categorized by the instructor according to difficulty or subject. Existing questions can be edited and new ones added. The Test Generator is compatible with several course management systems, including Blackboard.
Medical Topics Guide
This document highlights medically relevant topics covered throughout Molecular Biology of the Cell and The Problems Book. It will be particularly useful for instructors with a large number of premedical, health science, or nursing students.
Blackboard and Learning Management System (LMS) Integration
The movies, book images, and student assessments that accompany the book can be integrated into Blackboard or other LMSs. These resources are bundled into a “Common Cartridge” or “Upload Package” that facilitates bulk uploading of textbook resources into Blackboard and other LMSs. The LMS Common Cartridge can be obtained on a DVD from your sales representative or by emailing science@garland.com.
